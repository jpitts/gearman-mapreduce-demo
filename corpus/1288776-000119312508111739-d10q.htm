GOOGLE INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Unaudited)  Note 1. Google Inc. and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies  Nature of Operations  We were incorporated in California in September 1998. We were re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. We provide highly targeted
advertising and global internet search solutions as well as intranet solutions via an enterprise search appliance.  Basis of
Consolidation  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Google and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Unaudited Interim Financial Information  The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March31, 2008, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March31,
2007 and 2008, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March31, 2007 and 2008 are unaudited. These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. In our opinion, the unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of March31, 2008, our
results of operations for the three months ended March31, 2007 and 2008, and our cash flows for the three months ended March31, 2007 and 2008. The results of operations for the three months ended March31, 2008 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December31, 2008.  These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial
Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February15, 2008.  Use of Estimates  The
preparation of interim Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial
statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounts receivable, bad debt and sales allowances, fair values of
marketable and non-marketable securities, fair values of prepaid revenue share, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of options to purchase our common stock, and income taxes,
among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations
(SFAS141R). SFAS141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest
in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement is effective for us beginning January1,
2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS141R on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No.51 (SFAS160).
SFAS160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes
in a parent's ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for us beginning January1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS160 on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February 2008, the FASB issued Financial Staff Positions (FSP) FAS157-2,
Effective Date of FASB Statement No.157 (FSP FAS 157-2), which delays the effective date of SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurement (SFAS 157), for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities,
except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FSP
FAS 157-2 partially defers the effective date of SFAS157 to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. FSP FAS 157-2 is effective for us beginning
January1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of those provisions of SFAS 157, for which effectiveness was delayed by FSP SFAS 157-2, on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Note 2. Net Income per Share of ClassA and Class B common stock  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of ClassA and Class B common stock (in thousands, except
per share amounts, unaudited):

Table of Contents
The net income per share amounts are the same for ClassA and Class B because the holders of each
class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.  Note 3. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable
Securities  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consists of the following (in thousands):  
The following table summarizes unrealized gains and losses related to our investments in
marketable securities designated as available-for-sale (in thousands):

Table of Contents
Bank time deposits were held by institutions outside the U.S. at December31, 2007 and at
March31, 2008.  Gross unrealized gains and losses on cash equivalents were not material at December31, 2007 and March31,
2008. We recognized gross realized gains of $50.8 million and losses of $4.2 million on our marketable securities during the three months ended March31, 2008. Gross realized gains and losses were not material in the three months ended
March31, 2007. There were no other-than-temporary impairments to our marketable securities in the three months ended March31, 2007 and 2008. Realized gains and losses are included in interest income and other, net in our accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income.  The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt
securities designated as available-for-sale classified by the contractual maturity date of the security (in thousands):  
In accordance with EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments, the following table shows gross unrealized losses and fair value for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December31, 2007 and March31, 2008, aggregated by investment
category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in thousands):  
As of March31, 2008, we did not have any investments in marketable securities that were in
an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater.  Auction Rate Securities  At March31, 2008, we held $259.6million of auction rate securities which are included under municipal securities and auction rate preferred
securities in the above table. The assets underlying these investments are primarily student loans which are

substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government. Historically, these securities have provided liquidity through a Dutch auction at pre-determined intervals
every 7 to 49 days.However, these auctions began to fail in February 2008. As a result, these securities do not have a readily determinable market value and are not liquid. To determine their estimated fair values at March31, 2008, we
used a discounted cash flow model based on estimated interest rates over the period of time we expect to hold these securities.Based on this analysis, we recorded a temporary impairment of $10.8 million to accumulated other comprehensive
income on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at March31, 2008 (see Note 5).  To the extent we determine that any impairment
is other-than-temporary, we would record a charge to earnings. Also, if we ever determine that it is likely that the auctions for the auction rate securities we hold will continue to fail over the next 12 months or more, we would then reclassify
those securities to long-term assets from current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Note 4. Derivative Financial Instruments 
We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.  In accordance with SFAS
No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), we recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value (i.e., gains
or losses) of the derivatives are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income as interest income and other, net, or as part of revenues, or on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income.
Cash Flow Hedges  We
use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge
is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged exposure affects revenues or as interest income and other, net if the hedged transaction becomes probable of
not occurring. Any gain or loss after a hedge is de-designated because it is no longer probable of occurring or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge, as well as any amount excluded from our assessment of hedge effectiveness, is recognized as
interest income and other, net, immediately. These net gains or losses were not material in the quarter ended March31, 2008.  The
notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were 154.5million Canadian dollars (or approximately $151.4 million) and $3.0 million at March31, 2008. These foreign exchange
forward contracts and options have maturities of 18 months or less. There were no other foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.  Other Derivatives  Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS133 consist primarily of forward
contracts which we use to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in interest income and other,
net, along with those of the related hedged items. Neither the cost nor the fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was material at March31, 2008. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with
foreign currencies was $1.5 billion and $2.3 billion at December31, 2007 and March31, 2008. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other currencies was 296.5million (or approximately
$433.4 million) and 411.4million (or approximately $651.1 million) at December31, 2007 and March31, 2008. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for Taiwanese dollars was 18.7million
(or approximately $29.6 million) at March31, 2008.  Note 5. Fair Value Measurements  Effective January1, 2008, we adopted SFAS 157, except as it applies to the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities subject to FSP SFAS
157-2. SFAS 157 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:  
11 
Table of Contents
Level1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets.  Level2 - Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level3 - Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.  The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value.  In accordance with SFAS 157, we measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at
fair value. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are primarily classified within Level 1 or Level 2, with the exception of our investments in auction rate securities. This is because our cash equivalents and marketable securities are
valued primarily using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. Our investments in auction rate securities are classified within Level 3 because they are valued using a discounted cash flow
model (see Note 3). Some of the inputs to this model are unobservable in the market and are significant. Our foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable
data of similar instruments in inactive markets.  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are summarized below (unaudited, in
thousands):  
The following table presents our assets measured at fair value using significant unobservable
inputs (Level 3) as defined in SFAS 157 at March31, 2008 (unaudited, in thousands):  
12 
Table of Contents
Effective January1, 2008, we also adopted SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities  including an Amendment of FASB Statement No.115, which allows an entity to choose to measure certain financial instruments and liabilities at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis. Subsequent fair
value measurement for the financial instruments and liabilities an entity chooses to measure will be recognized in earnings. As of March31, 2008, we did not elect such option for our financial instruments and liabilities.  Note 6. Property and Equipment  Property and
equipment consist of the following (in thousands):  
Note7. Acquisitions  In March 2008, we completed our acquisition of Click Holding Corp. (DoubleClick), a company that offers online ad serving and management technology to advertisers, ad agencies and web site publishers. We
acquired DoubleClick primarily for their customer relationships, as well as patents and developed technology. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The total purchase price was $3.2 billion paid in cash, including transaction
costs of $52.1 million. In addition, we issued unvested options to purchase 127,320 shares of ClassA common stock valued at $50.6 million which will be recognized as stock-based compensation as the awards vest over the related vesting periods
of up to 47 months. These unvested awards are earned contingent upon each individual's continued employment with us.  The preliminary
allocation of the purchase price was based upon a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized are related to restructuring costs, income
taxes and residual goodwill. The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price of DoubleClick (unaudited, in thousands):  
Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.  Customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 6.7 years. Patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 5.0
years. Tradenames and other have a weighted-average useful life of 5.5 years. The majority of these assets are not deductible for tax purposes.

Supplemental information on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the DoubleClick acquisition had been
consummated at the beginning of each of the periods presented, is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):  
The unaudited pro forma supplemental information is based on estimates and assumptions, which we
believe are reasonable. It is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated financial position or results of income in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had we been a combined company as of the beginning of the
periods presented. The unaudited pro forma supplemental information includes incremental intangible asset amortization and other charges as a result of the acquisition, net of the related tax effects.  In connection with certain acquisitions in the prior periods, we are obligated to make additional cash payments if certain criteria are met. As of
March31, 2008, our remaining contingent obligations related to these acquisitions was approximately $591 million. Since these contingent payments are based on the achievement of performance targets, actual payments may be substantially lower.
Note 8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the three months ended March31, 2008, are as follows (in thousands):  
The goodwill adjustment of $178.4 million was primarily a result of contingent payments earned
upon the achievement of certain performance targets.  Information regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets that are being
amortized is as follows (in thousands):

Note 10. Comprehensive Income  The changes in the components of other comprehensive income, net of taxes, were as follows (in thousands):  
The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, were as follows (in
thousands):  
Note 11. Contingencies  Legal Matters  Companies have filed trademark infringement and related claims against us over
the display of ads in response to user queries that include trademark terms. The outcomes of these lawsuits have differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Courts in France have held us liable for allowing advertisers to select certain trademarked
terms as keywords. We are appealing those decisions. We were also subject to two lawsuits in Germany on similar matters where the courts held that we are not liable for the actions of our advertisers prior to notification of trademark rights. We are
litigating or have recently litigated similar issues in other cases in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Israel and Italy.

Table of Contents
We have also had copyright claims filed against us alleging that features of certain of our products and
services, including Google Web Search, Google News, Google Video, Google Image Search, Google Book Search and YouTube, infringe their rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or
licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain functionalities, and may also result in a change in our business practices, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or otherwise harm our business. In addition, any time one
of our products or services links to or hosts material in which others allegedly own copyrights, we face the risk of being sued for copyright infringement or related claims. Because these products and services comprise the majority of our products
and services, our business could be harmed in the event of an adverse result in any of these claims.  We have also experienced an increase
in patent lawsuits filed against us alleging that certain of our products and services, including Google Web Search, Google AdWords, and Google AdSense, infringe another party's patents. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of
substantial monetary damages, obligations to pay licensing fees and/or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or otherwise harm our business.
We are also a party to other litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property
claims (in addition to the trademark and copyright matters noted above), labor and employment claims, breach of contract claims, tax and other matters.  Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of the matters discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Income Taxes  We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and various other tax authorities. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our
provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of
operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates
of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.  Note 12.
Stockholders' Equity  The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock
options granted in the periods presented: 
The following table summarizes the activity for our options for the three months ended
March31, 2008:

Table of Contents
The following table summarizes additional information regarding outstanding, exercisable and exercisable and vested stock options at March31, 2008:  
Options outstanding at March31, 2008 in the above tables include 228,029 options granted and
exercised subsequent to March21, 2002 that are unvested at March31, 2008, in accordance with EITFIssue No. 00-23, Issues Related to Accounting for Stock Compensation Under APB Opinion No.25 and FASB Interpretation
No.44. However, the computations of the weighted-average exercise prices, weighted-average remaining contractual term and aggregate intrinsic value do not consider these unvested shares. Further, the above tables include 990,799 warrants
held by financial institutions that were options purchased from employees under our TSO program.  The total grant date fair value of stock
options vested during the three months ended March31, 2008 was $161.0 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options exercised during the period was $228.3 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold
under the TSO program.  During the three months ended March31, 2008, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial
institutions under the TSO program was 66,400 at a total value of $16.0 million, or an average of $241.26 per share, and an average premium of $41.52 per share. The premium is calculated as the difference between (a)the sale price of the TSO
and (b)the intrinsic value of the TSO, which we define as the excess, if any, of the price of our ClassA common stock at the time of the sale over the exercise price of the TSO. At March31, 2008, the number of options eligible for
participation under the TSO program was 8.7 million.  As of March31, 2008, there was $1,078.5 million of unrecognized compensation
cost related to outstanding employee stock options, net of forecasted forfeitures. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years. To the extent the forfeiture rate is different from what we have anticipated,
stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.  
17 
Table of Contents
The following table summarizes the activity for our unvested restricted stock units and restricted shares
for the three months ended March31, 2008:  
As of March31, 2008, there was $1,586.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to employee unvested restricted stock units and
restricted shares, net of forecasted forfeitures. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.4 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation
related to these awards will be different from our expectations.  Note 13. Income Taxes  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions
and determining our provision for income taxes. Financial Standards Accounting Board Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Our total unrecognized tax benefits as
of December31, 2007 and March31, 2008 were $387.2 million and $524.5 million. Also, our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $283.5 million and $387.2 million as of
December31, 2007 and March31, 2008, respectively. The increase in our unrecognized tax benefits during the three months ended March31, 2008 was primarily related to uncertain tax positions on our international structure.
Note 14. Information about Geographic Areas  Our chief operating decision-makers (i.e., our chief executive officer, his direct reports and our presidents) review financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by
geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. There are no segment managers who are held accountable by our chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for operations, operating results and
planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we consider ourselves to be in a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.  Revenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of the advertisers. The following table sets forth revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in thousands):

Note 15. Subsequent Event  In May 2008, Clearwire Corporation and Sprint Nextel Corporation agreed to combine certain businesses to form a wireless communication company, the new Clearwire. In addition, certain other companies have collectively
agreed to contribute $3.2 billion in cash to the new Clearwire or its subsidiary, including $500 million from us. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close during the second
half of 2008.  This investment will be a marketable equity security and will be classified and accounted for as available for sale. As a
result, it will be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of stockholders' equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary which will be recorded as interest
income and other, net, in accordance with our policy and FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments.

In addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include, among other things, statements concerning our expectations:  
as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects and business strategies. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this report, and in particular, the
risks discussed under the heading Risk Factors in Part II, Item1A of this report and those discussed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release
the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our Consolidated Financial
Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.  Overview  Google is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. Our innovations in web search and advertising have
made our web site a top internet destination and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. We serve three primary constituencies:

Table of Contents
How We
Generate Revenue  Advertising revenues made up 98% of our revenues for the three months ended March31, 2008 and 99% for the three
months ended March31, 2007. We derive the balance of our revenues from the license of our web search technology, the license of our search solutions to enterprises and the sale and license of other products and services.  Google AdWords is our automated online program that enables advertisers to place targeted text-based and display ads on our web sites and the web sites
of our Google Network members. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables
advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on Google Network members' sites specified by the advertiser. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-click pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers
each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results on our web sites or next to the search results or content on Google Network members' sites. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-impression pricing, we
recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time their ads are displayed on the Google Network members' sites. Our AdWords agreements are generally terminable at any time by our advertisers.  Google AdSense refers to the online and offline programs through which we distribute our advertisers' AdWords ads for display on the web sites of
our Google Network members as well as programs to deliver audio ads on radio broadcasts, print ads for display in newspapers and magazines, and ads on television broadcasts. Our AdSense programs include AdSense for search and AdSense for content.
AdSense for search is our online service for distributing relevant ads from our advertisers for display with search results on our Google
Network members' sites. To use AdSense for search, most of our AdSense for search partners add Google search functionality to their web pages in the form of customizable Google search boxes. When visitors of these web sites search either the
web site or the internet using these customizable search boxes, we display relevant ads on the search results pages, targeted to match user search queries. Ads shown through AdSense for search are generally text ads.  AdSense for content is our online service for distributing ads from our advertisers that are relevant to content on our Google Network members'
sites. Under this program, we use automated technology to analyze the meaning of the content on the web site and serve relevant ads based on the meaning of such content. For example, a web page on an automotive blog that contains an entry about
vintage cars might display ads for vintage car parts or vintage car shows. These ads are displayed in spaces that our AdSense for content partners have set aside on their web sites for our AdWords content. AdSense for content allows a variety of ad
types to be shown, including text ads, image ads, Google Video Ads, link units (which are sets of clickable links to topic pages related to page content), themed units (which are regular text ads with graphic treatments that change seasonally and by
geography) and gadget ads (which are customized mini-sites that run as ads on AdSense publisher web sites).  For our online
AdSense program, our advertisers pay us a fee each time a user clicks on one of our advertisers' ads displayed on Google Network members' web sites or, for those advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as their ads are
displayed. To date, we have paid most of these advertiser fees to the members of the Google Network, and we expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the portion of the advertiser fee
we pay to our Google Network members as traffic acquisition costs under cost of revenues. In some cases, we guarantee our Google Network members minimum revenue share payments based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of
search queries or advertisements displayed. Members of the Google Network do not pay any fees associated with the use of our AdSense program on their web sites.  Our agreements with Google Network members consist largely of uniform online click-wrap agreements that members enter into by interacting with our registration web sites. The standard agreements have no
stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements contain provisions requiring us to share with the Google Network member most of the
advertiser fees generated by users clicking on ads on the Google Network member's web site or, for advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as the ads are displayed on the Google Network member's web site.

We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license
their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements we display ads on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the
content providers and Google Network members. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the portion of the advertiser fee we pay to our content providers as content acquisition costs under cost of revenues. In some cases, we guarantee our
content providers minimum revenue share or other payments.  Our agreements with content providers are typically standard agreements with no
stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements contain provisions requiring us to pay the content providers for the content we
license or share, and the content providers receive most of the advertiser fees generated by ads displayed on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites.  We also distribute our advertisers' ads for publication in print media through our Google Print Ads program, and we recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers when their ads are published in print media.
Additionally, we distribute advertisers' audio ads for broadcast in radio programs through our Google Audio Ads program, and we recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time an ad is broadcasted or a listener responds to that ad.
In the fourth quarter of 2006, we acquired YouTube, a consumer media company for people to watch and share videos worldwide through the
web. We recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time an ad or a promoted video is displayed on the YouTube site.  In the
second quarter of 2007, we began delivering Google TV ads to viewers and helping advertisers, operators and programmers buy, schedule, deliver and measure ads on television. We recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time an ad is
displayed on TV in accordance with the terms of the related agreements.  We believe the factors that influence the success of our
advertising programs include the following:  
We believe that the monetization of traffic on our web sites, and our Google Network members' web sites is affected by the following factors:
Trends in Our
Business  Our business has grown rapidly since inception, resulting in substantially increased revenues, and we expect that our business
will continue to grow. However, our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time, and we expect it will continue to do so as a result of increasing competition and the difficulty of maintaining growth rates as our revenues increase to higher
levels. In addition, the main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to our users, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we may continue to take steps to
improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites. These steps include removing ads that generate low click- 
22 
Table of Contents
through rates or that send users to irrelevant or otherwise low quality sites and terminating Google Network members whose web sites do not meet our quality
requirements. In addition, we may continue to take steps to reduce the number of accidental clicks. These steps could negatively affect our near-term advertising revenues.  Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business.
Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly
results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue and paid click growth rates.  From the inception of the Google Network in 2002
through the first quarter of 2004, the growth in advertising revenues from our Google Network members' web sites exceeded that from our web sites, which had a negative impact on our operating margins. The operating margin we realize on revenues
generated from ads placed on our Google Network members' web sites through our AdSense program is significantly lower than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from ads placed on our web sites because most of the advertiser
fees from ads served on Google Network member web sites are shared with our Google Network members. However, beginning in the second quarter of 2004, growth in advertising revenues from our web sites has exceeded that from our Google Network
members' web sites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future, although the relative rate of growth in revenues from our web sites compared to the rate of
growth in revenues from our Google Network members' web sites may vary over time.  We are heavily investing in building the necessary
employee and systems infrastructures required to manage our growth and develop and promote our products and services, and this may cause our operating margins to decrease. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial growth
in our operations as we build our research and development programs, expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members and content providers and increase our presence in international markets. Also, we have acquired and expect to
continue to acquire businesses and other assets from time to time. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies and our product offerings. In addition, we are
incurring significant costs and expenses to support our Google Checkout product and promote its adoption by merchants and consumers, as well as promote the distribution of certain other products, including the Google Toolbar. Our full-time employee
headcount has significantly increased over the last 12 months, growing from 12,238 at March31, 2007 to 19,156 at March31, 2008, including approximately 1,500 new employees as a result of our acquisition of DoubleClick. We also utilize a
significant number of temporary employees. We also expect to continue to make significant capital expenditure investments in, among other things, information and technology infrastructure and corporate facilities. In April 2007, we launched our TSO
program. We modified employee options at that time to allow them to participate in this program, and as a result we incurred a modification charge of approximately $104 million through March31, 2008 related to vested options, and we expect to
incur an additional modification charge of approximately $125 million related to unvested options over their remaining vesting periods through the second quarter of 2011. In addition, the fair value of each option granted under the TSO program will
be greater than it would have been otherwise because of a longer expected life, resulting in more stock-based compensation per option. As a result of all of the above, the growth rate of our costs and expenses may exceed the growth rate of our
revenues.  We expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2008 and in
future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs and credit card and other transaction fees, including transaction processing fees related to Google Checkout, as well as content
acquisition costs. In particular, traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may increase in the future if we are unable to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on our web sites and our Google Network members'
web sites, particularly with those members to whom we have guaranteed minimum revenue share payments.  Our international revenues grew as a
percentage of our total revenues to 51% in the three months ended March31, 2008 from 48% in the three months ended December31, 2007 and from 47% in the three months ended March31, 2007. This increase in the portion of our revenues
derived from international markets results largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs, increases in our direct sales resources and customer support operations and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our
products in these international markets, as well as an increase in the value of the Euro, the British pound and other foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar over these periods. The increase in the proportion of international revenues derived
from international markets increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates.  Results of Operations

periods presented (unaudited):  
Growth in our revenues in the three months ended March31, 2008 compared to the three months
ended December31, 2007 resulted primarily from growth in advertising revenues for Google web sites, and to a lesser extent, Google Network web sites. Our advertising revenue growth for Google web sites and Google Network web sites resulted
primarily from an increase in the total number of paid clicks and ads displayed through our programs, rather than from changes in the average fees paid by our advertisers. The increase in the number of paid clicks and ads displayed through our
programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic on our web sites, certain monetization improvements and the continued global expansion of our products, our advertiser base and our user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google
Network members and distribution partners.  Growth in our revenues in the three months ended March31, 2008 compared to the three
months ended March31, 2007 resulted primarily from growth in advertising revenues for Google web sites and Google Network web sites. Our advertising revenue growth for Google web sites and Google Network web sites resulted primarily from
increases in the total number of paid clicks and ads displayed through our programs, rather than from changes in the average fees paid by our advertisers. The increase in the number of paid clicks and ads displayed through our programs was due to an
increase in aggregate traffic on both our web sites and those of our Google Network members, certain improvements in the monetization of increased traffic on our web sites and our Google Network member sites, the continued global expansion of our
products, our advertiser base and our user base, and an increase in the number of Google Network members and distribution partners.  Improvements in our ability to ultimately monetize this increased traffic primarily relate to enhancing the end user experience, including providing end users with ads that are more relevant to their search queries or to the content on the
Google Network members' sites they visit. These improvements have included, for instance, a change to the formula used to determine which ads appear at the top of our search results pages, a change to consider not only a user's current
search query, but also their immediately preceding query, to determine the ads displayed on our search results pages, and a change to the clickable area around our AdSense for content text-based ads to only the title and URL to reduce the number of
accidental clicks.  Our sequential quarterly revenue growth rate decreased from 14.1% for the three months ended December31, 2007, to
7.5% for the three months ended March31, 2008.  The sequential quarterly revenue growth rate from Google web sites decreased from
14.1% for the three months ended December31, 2007, to 8.9% for the three months ended March31, 2008. The sequential quarterly revenue growth rate from our Google Network members' web sites decreased from 12.5% for the three months
ended December31, 2007, to 3.1% for the three months ended March31, 2008. These decreases in the sequential quarterly revenue growth rates are primarily the result of our higher revenue levels and seasonal slowdowns in internet usage and
commercial queries. In addition, during the three months ended March31, 2008, we terminated relationships with certain Google Network members who did not comply with our AdSense policies, which adversely affected our revenues. The sequential
quarterly revenue growth from our web sites has been greater than that from our Google Network members' web sites primarily as a result of a greater increase in the total number of paid clicks on our web sites, which was largely due to higher
traffic growth and monetization improvements. We expect that our revenue growth rates will generally decline in the future as a result of increasing competition and the difficulty of maintaining growth rates as our revenues increase to higher
levels.  Aggregate paid clicks on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites increased approximately 4% from the three
months ended December31, 2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008, and increased approximately 20% from the three months ended March31, 2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008. In general, the increase in paid clicks
has historically correlated with increases in our revenues. However, the rate of increase in paid clicks, and its correlation with the rate of increase in revenues, may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on various factors including
seasonality, advertiser competition for keywords 
25 
Table of Contents
and the revenue growth rates on our web sites compared to those of our Google Network members. In addition, traffic growth in emerging markets compared to
more mature markets and across various advertising verticals also contributes to these fluctuations.  We believe that the increase in the
number of paid clicks and ads displayed through our programs is substantially the result of our commitment to improving the relevance and quality of both our search results and the advertisements displayed, which we believe results in a better user
experience, which in turn results in more searches, advertisers, and Google Network members and other partners. Revenues realized through the Google Print Ads Program, Google Audio Ads, Google TV Ads, Google Checkout, YouTube, Postini and
DoubleClick were not material in any of the periods presented.  Revenues by Geography  Domestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our advertisers, are set forth
below (unaudited):  
The growth in international revenues in the three months ended March31, 2008 compared to the
three months ended December31, 2007 and the three months ended March31, 2007 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs, increases in our direct sales resources and customer support operations in international
markets and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets. Furthermore, the growth in international revenues from the three months ended December31, 2007 to the three months ended
March31, 2008 resulted from seasonally stronger traffic and monetization in certain advertising verticals, such as travel and finance in the United Kingdom and certain other countries compared to the U.S.  In addition, the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and the British pound) in the three months ended
March31, 2008 compared to the three months ended December31, 2007 had a favorable impact on our international revenues, which increased $329.8 million. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our total revenues
would have been approximately $18.1 million, or 0.3%, lower. The weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and the British pound) in the three months ended March31, 2008 compared to the three months
ended March31, 2007 had a favorable impact on our international revenues, which increased $945.0 million. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our total revenues would have been approximately $202.0 million, or 3.9%,
lower.  Although we expect to continue to make investments in international markets, they may not result in an increase in our
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2008 or thereafter. See Note14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this Form 10-Q for additional information about geographic areas.  Costs and Expenses  Cost of Revenues.
Cost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our
Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search
queries to our web site (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share arrangements with our Google Network members and distribution partners. Certain distribution
arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusivelyor at allbased on revenue share. The fees are paid when the access points are delivered or based on revenue share and are
non-refundable. Further, the arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements
over the estimated useful lives of the access points (two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to
expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenue.  In addition, certain AdSense agreements obligate us to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google Network members based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or
advertisements displayed. These fees may be paid in advance or in arrears and are non-refundable but are subject to adjustment based on the achievement of the 
26 
Table of Contents
defined performance terms. In addition, the arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our Google Network
members may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. To the extent we expect revenues generated under an arrangement to exceed the guaranteed minimum revenue share payments, we recognize traffic acquisition costs on a contractual
revenue share basis or on a basis proportionate to forecasted revenues, whichever is greater. Otherwise, we recognize the guaranteed revenue share payments as traffic acquisition costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the related
agreements. In addition, concurrent with the commencement of a small number of AdSense and other agreements, we have purchased certain items from, or provided other consideration to, our Google Network members and partners. We have determined that
certain of these amounts are prepaid traffic acquisition costs and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related agreements.  Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions as
well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements we display ads on the pages of our web sites
and our Google Network members' web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers and the Google Network members. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum
revenue share or other payments to our content providers, we recognize content acquisition costs equal to the greater of the following three amounts: the contractual revenue share amount, if any, based on the number of times the content is
displayed, or on a straight-line basis over the terms of the agreements. The following tables present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and our traffic acquisition costs and traffic acquisition costs as a
percentage of advertising revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
Cost of revenues increased $154.7 million from the three months ended December31, 2007 to
the three months ended March31, 2008. There was an increase in data center costs of $66.0 million primarily as a result of the depreciation of additional information technology assets and data center buildings as well as additional personnel
required to manage the data centers. Over this same period there was an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $46.6 million, which includes an increase of $17.9 million in fees related to distribution arrangements. In addition, there was an
increase in content acquisition costs of $27.0 million and an increase in amortization of intangible assets of $10.0 million primarily as a result of our acquisition of DoubleClick. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of
advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of advertising revenues coming from our web sites rather than from our Google Network members' web sites. The traffic acquisition costs associated with revenues generated
from ads placed on our web sites is considerably lower than the traffic acquisition costs associated with revenues generated from ads placed on our Google Network members' web sites.  Cost of revenues increased $640.1 million from the three months ended March31, 2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008. Over the same
period there was an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $361.4 million primarily resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program, and to a lesser extent, an increase of $70.0 million in fees related to distribution
arrangements, and an increase in data center costs of $196.8 million primarily resulting from the depreciation of additional information technology assets as well as additional labor required to manage the data centers. In addition, there was an
increase in content acquisition costs of $31.7 million and an increase in the amortization of intangible assets of $24.3 million primarily resulting from acquisitions in the current and prior periods, and an increase in credit card and other
transaction processing fees of $13.4 million resulting from more advertiser fees being generated through AdWords. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of
advertising revenues coming from our web sites rather than from our Google Network members' web sites.  We expect cost of revenues to
continue to increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2008 and in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, credit card and other transaction fees,
27 
Table of Contents
including transaction processing fees related to Google Checkout, content acquisition and other costs. Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of
advertising revenues may fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, including:  
Research and Development.  The
following table presents our research and development expenses, and research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for
personnel responsible for the research and development of new products and services, as well as significant improvements to existing products and services. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.  Research and development expenses increased $42.3 million from the three months ended December31, 2007 to the three months ended March31,
2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $32.4 million. In addition, labor and facilities related costs increased $20.7million as a result of a 13% increase in research and development headcount which
also includes the increased headcount resulting from our acquisition of DoubleClick.  Research and development expenses increased $264.7
million from the three months ended March31, 2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities related costs of $149.2million as a result of a 60% increase in
research and development headcount. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $73.0 million, an increase in fees for professional services of $22.7 million and an increase in depreciation and related expenses of $11.4
million due to our increased capital expenditures.  We anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount and
may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2008 and future periods because we expect to hire more research and development personnel and build the infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, products and
services.  Sales and Marketing.  The following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel
engaged in customer service and sales and sales support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenditures.  
28 
Table of Contents
Sales and marketing expenses increased $24.6 million from the three months ended December31, 2007
to the three months ended March31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities related costs of $29.4 million mostly as a result of a 16% increase in sales and marketing headcount which also includes the
increased headcount resulting from our acquisition of DoubleClick. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in advertising and promotional activities.  Sales and marketing expenses increased $144.3 million from the three months ended March31, 2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and
facilities related costs of $106.3 million mostly as a result of a 54% increase in sales and marketing headcount, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $15.3 million.  We anticipate sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2008 and future
periods as we continue to expand our business on a worldwide basis. A significant portion of these increases relate to our plan to hire additional personnel and increase advertising and promotional expenditures to increase the level of service we
provide to our advertisers and Google Network members. We also plan to add more international sales personnel to support our worldwide expansion.  General and Administrative.  The following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for
personnel and facilities related to our finance, human resources, facilities, information technology and legal organizations, and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information
technology consulting and outsourcing services.  General and administrative expenses increased $32.3 million from the three months ended
December31, 2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008, primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of $21.2 million as a result of increased risk in this area. In addition, there was an increase in fees for professional services
of $14.7 million.  General and administrative expenses increased $147.9 million from the three months ended March31, 2007 to the
three months ended March31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities related costs of $47.2 million primarily as a result of a 59% increase in headcount. In addition, there was an increase in fees for
professional services of $40.3 million and an increase in depreciation related expense of $10.5 million.  As we expand our business and
incur additional expenses, we believe general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2008 and future periods.  Stock-Based Compensation.  The
following table presents our stock-based compensation, and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
Stock-based compensation increased $35.5 million from the three months ended December31,
2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008, and $96.9 million from the three months ended March31, 2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008. These increases were primarily due to additional stock awards issued to existing and
new employees.  
29 
Table of Contents
We expect stock-based compensation to be approximately $1.1 billion in 2008 and $1.9 billion thereafter.
These amounts do not include stock-based compensation related to stock awards that have been and may be granted to employees and directors subsequent to March31, 2008 and stock awards that have been or may be granted to non-employees. In
addition, to the extent forfeiture rates are different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to
employees will be at or below 2% this year.  Interest Income and Other, Net  Interest income and other of $167.3 million in the three months ended March31, 2008 primarily consisted of $122.0 million of interest income earned
on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. In addition, we recognized $46.6 million of realized gains on sales of marketable securities.  Interest income and other of $130.7 million in the three months ended March31, 2007 primarily consisted of $130.5 million of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
balances.  Provision for Income Taxes  The following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
Our effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended December31, 2007 to the three
months ended March31, 2008, primarily as a result of proportionately more of our annual earnings expected to be realized in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates in 2008 compared to 2007.  Our provision for income taxes increased from the three months ended March31, 2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008, primarily as a
result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income period over period. Our effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended March31, 2007 to the three months ended March31, 2008, primarily as a
result of proportionately more of our annual earnings expected to be realized in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates in 2008 compared to 2007.  Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher
than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are
subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  In summary, our cash flows were (in millions, unaudited):  
At March31, 2008, we had $12.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., time deposits as well as U.S. corporate securities. Marketable securities also include auction rate
securities (ARS) of $259.6 million. The related auctions began to fail in February 2008. As a result, these securities are currently illiquid. Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this report provides
further discussion on ARS and the composition of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.  
30 
Table of Contents
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as
the cash flow that we generate from our operations. At December31, 2007 and March31, 2008, we had unused letters of credit for approximately $20.4 million and $54.8 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and
services. In addition, we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund any such
acquisitions and licensing activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.  Cash provided by
operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, in-process research and development, stock-based compensation, excess tax benefits from stock-based award activity, and the effect
of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended March31, 2008 was $1,779.4 million and consisted of net income of $1,307.1 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $483.1
million and cash used in working capital and other activities of $10.8 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $280.8 million of stock-based compensation, $280.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and
equipment and $56.0 million of amortization of intangibles and other, partially offset by $51.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activity. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a decrease of
$234.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily as a result of employee bonuses for the year ended December31, 2007 paid in the first quarter of 2008, and an increase of $223.5 million in accounts receivable due to the
growth in fees billed to our advertisers and an increase of $41.6 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, partially offset by a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $438.2 million (which includes the
same $51.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards included under adjustments for non-cash items) and to a lesser extent by an increase in accounts payable of $53.8 million. The increase in income taxes payable and deferred income
taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, as well as less estimated income taxes paid, in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  Cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended March31, 2007 was $1,219.6 million and consisted of net income of $1,002.2 million,
adjustments for non-cash items of $247.0 million and cash used in working capital and other activities of $29.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $183.9 million of stock-based compensation and $170.3 million of
depreciation expense on property and equipment, partially offset by $74.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activity. In addition, working capital activities primarily consisted of an increase of $185.5 million in prepaid revenue
share, expenses and other assets, an increase of $153.6 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers, a decrease of $169.1 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities and accounts payable primarily as a
result of employee bonuses for the year ended December31, 2006 paid in the first quarter of 2007, partially offset by a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $399.1 million which includes the same $74.1 million of
excess tax benefits from stock-based award included under adjustments for non-cash items. The increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, as well as less estimated income
taxes paid, in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006.  As we expand our business internationally, we have offered
payment terms to certain advertisers that are standard in their locales, but longer than terms we would generally offer to our domestic advertisers. This may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative effect on cash provided
by our operating activities. In addition, since we have become a public company our cash-based compensation per employee has increased and will likely continue to increase in order to attract and retain employees.  Cash used in investing activities in the three months ended March31, 2008 of $1,407.0 million was attributable to cash consideration used in
acquisitions of $3,125.1 million, primarily related to the DoubleClick acquisition and capital expenditures of $841.6 million, partially offset by net proceeds received from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2,559.7 million. Cash
used in investing activities in the three months ended March31, 2007 of $777.1 million was attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $145.8 million, capital expenditures of $596.9 million and cash consideration used in
acquisitions and other investments of $34.4 million. Capital expenditures are mainly for the purchase of information technology assets. In order to manage expected increases in internet traffic, advertising transactions and new products and
services, and to support our overall global business expansion, we will continue to invest heavily in data center operations, technology, corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure in 2008 and thereafter.  In addition, we expect to spend a significant amount of cash on acquisitions and other investments from time to time. These acquisitions generally
enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies and our product offerings. In connection with certain acquisitions, we are obligated to make additional cash payments if certain criteria are
met. As of March31, 2008, our remaining contingent obligations related to these acquisitions was approximately $591 million. Since these contingent payments are based on the achievement of performance targets, actual payments may be
substantially lower. In May 2008, Clearwire Corporation and Sprint Nextel Corporation agreed to combine certain businesses to form a wireless communication company, 
31 
Table of Contents
the new Clearwire. In addition, certain other companies have collectively agreed to contribute $3.2 billion in cash to the new Clearwire or its subsidiary,
including $500 million from us. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close during the second half of 2008.  Also, as part of our philanthropic program, we expect to make donations as well as investments in for-profit enterprises that aim to alleviate poverty,
improve the environment or achieve other socially or economically progressive objectives. We expect these payments to be made primarily in cash. We have authorized up to $175 million of such payments over the three years ending December31,
2008, with any unallocated amounts to be rolled over into the following year. The majority of this authorized amount has not been spent or committed.  Cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended March31, 2008 of $28.7 million was primarily due to excess tax benefits of $51.1 million from stock-based award activities during the period which
represents a portion of the $70.3 million reduction to income taxes payable that we recorded in the first quarter of 2008 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale or vesting of these awards, as well as net payments
related to stock-based award activity of $22.4 million. Net payments result when the tax withholding payments we make on behalf of our employees upon the net settlement of their vested restricted stock units exceeds the cash we receive upon the
exercise of stock options. Cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended March31, 2007 of $88.5 million was primarily due to excess tax benefits of $74.1 million from stock-based award activity during the period which
represents a portion of the $107.1 million reduction to income taxes payable that we recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale or vesting of these awards. In addition, we
receivednet proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock-based award activity of $14.4 million.  Contractual
Obligations  We are obligated under certain agreements to make non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google
Network members based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. At March31, 2008, our aggregate outstanding non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share commitments totaled
$1,598.7 million through 2012 compared to $1,746.4 million at December31, 2007.  In addition, as of a result of having adopted FIN 48
(discussed below under Income Taxes) in January 2007, we increased long-term taxes payable by $400.4 million in the year ended December31, 2007 as FIN 48 specifies that tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain
should be recognized as long-term liabilities. We also recognized additional long-term taxes payable of $140.3 million in the quarter ended March31, 2008. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of
payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In doing so, we
have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different
accounting policies and estimates. In some cases changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material
differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we
evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit
committee of our board of directors.  Income Taxes  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions
and determining our provision for income taxes. Effective January1, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48).
FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax
benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  Although we believe we have adequately
reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the 
32 
Table of Contents
closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded,
such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well
as the related net interest.  Our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign
operations, research and experimentation tax credits, state taxes, and certain benefits realized related to stock option activity. The effective tax rate was 25.0% and 23.7% for the three months ended December31, 2007 and March31, 2008,
respectively. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the
Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.  Stock-Based Compensation  We
account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123R. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton
(BSM) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates and expected option life. If any of the
assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.  Traffic Acquisition Costs  We are obligated under certain agreements to make non-cancelable
guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google Network members based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. To the extent we expect revenues generated under such an
arrangement to exceed the guaranteed minimum revenue share payments, we recognize traffic acquisition costs on a contractual revenue share basis or on a basis proportionate to forecasted revenues, whichever is greater; if our estimate of revenues
under such an arrangement is subsequently revised downward, then the amount of traffic acquisition costs we would recognize thereafter would be proportionately greater. Otherwise, we recognize the guaranteed revenue share payments as traffic
acquisition costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the related agreements.  Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS141R). SFAS141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the
business combination. This statement is effective for us beginning January1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS141R on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of
Accounting Research Bulletin No.51 (SFAS160). SFAS160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net
income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent's ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS160 also establishes
disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for us beginning January1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the
potential impact of the adoption of SFAS160 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In
February 2008, the FASB issued Financial Staff Positions (FSP) FAS157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No.157 (FSP FAS 157-2), which delays the effective date of SFAS No.157, Fair Value
Measurement (SFAS 157), for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS 157 establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FSP FAS 157-2 partially defers the effective date of SFAS157 to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008, and interim periods within those
fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. FSP FAS 157-2 is effective for us beginning January1, 
33 
Table of Contents
2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of those provisions of SFAS 157, for which effectiveness was delayed by FSP SFAS
157-2, on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.  
We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.  Foreign Exchange
Risk  Economic Exposure  We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. We purchase foreign exchange forward and option
contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are
not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. In accordance with SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedge Activities (SFAS 133), these contracts are designated as
cash flow hedges. The gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings or
when the hedged transaction is no longer probable of occurring. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion, if any, of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. At March31, 2008, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange
contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were 154.5million Canadian dollars (or approximately $151.4 million) and $3.0 million. These foreign exchange forward contracts and options have maturities of 18 months or less. There
are no other foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, however, we may enter into similar contracts in other foreign currencies in the future. The net gains or losses on the effective and ineffective portions of these cash flow
hedges were not material at March31, 2008 and in the quarter ended March31, 2008.  We considered the historical trends in
currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% for our foreign currencies instruments could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in a decrease of
$4.0 million in the fair values of our foreign currency instruments designated as cash flow hedges.  Transaction Exposure
Our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign
subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency. We have
entered into foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to
purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $1.5 billion and $2.3 billion at December31, 2007 and March31, 2008. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other currencies was
296.5million (or approximately $433.4 million) and 411.4million (or approximately $651.1 million) at December31, 2007 and March31, 2008. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for
Taiwanese dollars was 18.7million (or approximately $29.6 million) at March31, 2008.  We considered the historical trends
in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before
income taxes of approximately $39.7 million and $14.7 million at December31, 2007 and March31, 2008. The adverse impact at December31, 2007 and March31, 2008 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately
$163.7million and $244.2million from forward exchange contracts in place for the months of December 2007 and March 2008. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to total monetary assets denominated
in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before taxes in the near term.  Interest Rate Risk  We invest in a
variety of securities, consisting primarily of investments in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions, tax-exempt money market funds and debt securities of corporations and municipalities. By policy, we limit the amount
of credit exposure to any one issuer.  
34 
Table of Contents
Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest
rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our
income from investments may decrease in the future.  We considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined
that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis-point) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our
marketable securities of approximately $86.7 million and $74.2 million at December31, 2007 and March31, 2008.  
(a) Evaluation of
disclosure controls and procedures.  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of
disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  Based onour evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting to ensure we maintain an effective internal control environment. As we grow
geographically and with new product offerings, we continue to create new processes and controls as well as improve our existing environment to increase efficiencies. Improvements may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient
systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART IIOTHER INFORMATION  
From time to time, we are
involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax and
other matters. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of our current pending matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In
addition, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. See the risk factors
We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future and Our
intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand in the Risks Related to Our Business and Industry section of Item1A of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.  
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
We face significant competition from Microsoft and Yahoo.  We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, and particularly from other companies that seek to connect people with information on the
web and provide them with relevant advertising. Currently, we consider our primary competitors to be Microsoft Corporation and Yahoo! Inc. Microsoft has developed features that make web search a more integrated part of its Windows operating system
and other desktop software products. We expect that Microsoft will increasingly use its financial and engineering resources to compete with us. Microsoft has more employees and cash resources than we do. Also, both Microsoft and Yahoo have longer
operating histories and more established relationships with customers and end users. They can use their experience and resources against us in a variety of competitive ways, including by making acquisitions, investing more aggressively in research
and development and competing more aggressively for advertisers and web sites. Microsoft and Yahoo also may have a greater ability to attract and retain users than we do because they operate internet portals with a broad range of content products
and services. If Microsoft or Yahoo are successful in providing similar or better web search results or more relevant advertisements, or in leveraging their platforms or products to make their web search or advertising services easier to access, we
could experience a significant decline in user traffic or the size of the Google Network. Any such decline could negatively affect our revenues.  We face competition from other internet companies, including web search providers, internet access providers, internet advertising companies and destination web sites.  In addition to Microsoft and Yahoo, we face competition from other web search providers, including start-ups as well as developed companies that are
enhancing or developing search technologies. We compete with internet advertising companies, particularly in the areas of pay-for-performance and keyword-targeted internet advertising. Also, we may compete with companies that sell products and
services online because these companies, like us, are trying to attract users to their web sites to search for information about products and services. We also provide a number of online products and services, including Google Checkout, YouTube and
our communications tools such as Google Docs, that compete directly with new and established companies that offer communication, information and entertainment services integrated into their products or media properties.  We also compete with web sites that provide their own or user-generated content and provide advertising to their users. These destination web sites
include those operated by internet access providers, such as cable and DSL service providers. Because our users need to access our services through internet access providers, they have direct relationships with these providers. If an access provider
or a computer or computing device manufacturer offers online services that compete with ours, the user may find it more convenient to use the services of the access provider or manufacturer. In addition, the access provider or manufacturer may make
it hard to access our services by not listing them in the access provider's or manufacturer's own menu of offerings, or may charge users to access our web sites or the web sites of our Google Network members. Also, because the access
provider gathers information from the user in connection with the establishment of a billing relationship, the access provider may be more effective than we are in tailoring services and advertisements to the specific tastes of the user. 
There has been a trend toward industry consolidation among our competitors, and so smaller competitors today may become larger competitors in the
future. If our competitors are more successful than we are at generating traffic, our revenues may decline.  
36 
Table of Contents
We face competition from traditional media companies, and we may not be included in the advertising
budgets of large advertisers, which could harm our operating results.  In addition to internet companies, we face competition from
companies that offer traditional media advertising opportunities. Most large advertisers have fixed advertising budgets, a small portion of which is allocated to internet advertising. We expect that large advertisers will continue to focus most of
their advertising efforts on traditional media. If we fail to convince these companies to spend a portion of their advertising budgets with us, or if our existing advertisers reduce the amount they spend on our programs, our operating results would
be harmed.  We expect our revenue growth rate to decline and anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.
We expect that our revenue growth rate will decline over time and anticipate that there will be downward pressure on our operating
margin. We believe our revenue growth rate will generally decline as a result of increasing competition and the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels. We believe our operating margin will experience downward
pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business. Our operating margin will also experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google
Network members' sites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own sites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Toolbar. The margin on revenue we
generate from our Google Network members is significantly less than the margin on revenue we generate from advertising on our web sites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenue generated from our Google Network members could decrease in the
future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network members.  Our operating results may fluctuate,
which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.  Our operating results may
fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future
performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events
could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this Item1A and the following factors may affect our operating results:  
Because our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting
our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns. For example, in 1999, advertisers spent heavily on internet
advertising. This was followed by a lengthy downturn in ad spending on the web. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the
cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.  If we do not
continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.  Our success depends on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful and enjoyable experience for our users. Our competitors
are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising and web based products and services. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our web search 
37 
Table of Contents
technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to
provide quality products and services, then our users may become dissatisfied and move to a competitor's products and services. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers
and Google Network members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market. As search technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer search results that are, or that are seen to
be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.  We generate our revenue almost entirely from advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.  We generated 99% of our revenues in 2007 and 98% of our revenues for the first three months of 2008 from our advertisers. Our advertisers can generally
terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in
an appropriate and effective manner. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would negatively harm our revenues and business. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend
to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Any decreases in or delays in advertising spending due to general economic conditions could reduce our revenues or negatively impact our ability to grow our
revenues.  We rely on our Google Network members for a significant portion of our revenues, and we benefit from our association with
them. The loss of these members could adversely affect our business.  We provide advertising, web search and other services to
members of our Google Network, which accounted for 35% of our revenues in 2007 and 32% of our revenues in the three months ended March31, 2008. Some of the participants in this network may compete with us in one or more areas. They may decide
in the future to terminate their agreements with us. If our Google Network members decide to use a competitor's or their own web search or advertising services, our revenues would decline. Our agreements with a few of the largest Google Network
members account for a significant portion of revenues derived from our AdSense program. If our relationship with one or more large Google Network members were terminated or renegotiated on terms less favorable to us, our business could be adversely
affected.  Also, certain of our key network members operate high-profile web sites, and we derive tangible and intangible benefits from
this affiliation. If one or more of these key relationships is terminated or not renewed, and is not replaced with a comparable relationship, our business would be adversely affected.  Our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be
harmed.  We have experienced, and continue to experience, rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will
continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and
operating results. Our expansion and growth in international markets heightens these risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems,
alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. These
systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position.  Our business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users,
advertisers and Google Network members.  The brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of
our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Google brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members, and other partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the
relatively low barriers to entry in the internet market. If we fail to maintain and enhance the Google brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially
and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.  Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences.  We do not have a great deal of experience acquiring companies, and the companies we have acquired have typically been small. However, recently, we have
closed a number of larger acquisitions, including our acquisitions of DoubleClick, Postini and YouTube, and are in the process of integrating these businesses into our own. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions 
38 
Table of Contents
regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The
process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology has created, and will continue to create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:  
In addition, foreign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above,
including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.  Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause
us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.  Future acquisitions or dispositions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial
condition. Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. For example, we have
yet to realize significant revenue benefits from our acquisitions of dMarc Broadcasting (Audio Ads), YouTube or Postini.  Our
international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.  International revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our total revenues in the first three months of 2008, and more than half of our user traffic came from outside the U.S. during this period. We have limited experience with operations
outside the U.S. and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:  
In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our
employees to fines and penalties. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data
privacy requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal
sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, 
39 
Table of Contents
there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our
ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating
results.  Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the
innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.  We believe that a critical contributor
to our success has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly
difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.  Our
intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.  Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and
services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our
proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.
Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.  Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain
innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word Google could become so commonly
used that it becomes synonymous with the word search. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word Google to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our
brand.  We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or
intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.  We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. 
Companies in the internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter
into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased. Our products, services and technologies may not be able to
withstand any third-party claims and regardless of the merits of the claim, intellectual property claims are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay
substantial monetary damages or discontinue any of our services or practices that are found to be in violation of another party's rights. We also may have to seek a license to continue such practices, which may significantly increase our
operating expenses. In addition, many of our agreements with members of our Google Network and other partners require us to indemnify these members for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as
a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims.  Companies have
filed trademark infringement and related claims against us over the display of ads in response to user queries that include trademark terms. The outcomes of these lawsuits have differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Courts in France have held
us liable for allowing advertisers to select certain trademarked terms as keywords. We are appealing those decisions. We were also subject to two lawsuits in Germany on similar matters where the courts held that we are not liable for the actions of
our advertisers prior to notification of trademark rights. We are litigating or have recently litigated similar issues in other cases in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Israel and Italy.  We have also had copyright claims filed against us alleging that features of certain of our products and services, including Google Web Search, Google
News, Google Video, Google Image Search, Google Book Search and YouTube, infringe another party's rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders
preventing us from offering certain functionalities, and may also result in a change in our business practices, which could 
40 
Table of Contents
result in a loss of revenue for us or otherwise harm our business. In addition, any time one of our products or services links to or hosts material in which
others allegedly own copyrights, we face the risk of being sued for copyright infringement or related claims. Because these products and services comprise the majority of our products and services, the risk of harm from such lawsuits could be
substantial.  We have also experienced an increase in patent lawsuits filed against us alleging that certain of our products and services,
including Google Web Search, Google AdWords, and Google AdSense, infringe another party's patents. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, obligations to pay licensing fees and/or orders preventing
us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or otherwise harm our business.  Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.  From time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products and services compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our
practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. While we strive to comply with all applicable data
protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, which could potentially have an adverse effect
on our business.  In addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web based, the amount of data we store for our users on our
servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users' data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services as well as harm our
reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the
number of web based products and services we offer as well as increase the number of countries where we operate.  A number of legislative
proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concern data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of data protection laws in Europe and elsewhere are still uncertain and in
flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices,
which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.  Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws that could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business. 
We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management
time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have been threatened and filed under
both U.S. and foreign law for defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads
posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users.  In addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has
provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing or linking to third-party web sites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act.
The Child Online Protection Act and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information
from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. We face similar risks and costs as our
products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.  Any failure on our part to comply
with these laws and regulations may subject us to additional liabilities.  We compete internationally with local information
providers and with U.S. competitors who are currently more successful than we are in various markets, and if we fail to compete effectively in international markets, our business will be harmed.  We face different market characteristics and competition outside the U.S. In certain markets, other web search, advertising services and internet
companies have greater brand recognition, more users and more search traffic than we have. Even in countries where we have a significant user following, we may not be as successful in generating advertising revenue due to slower market development,
our inability to provide attractive local advertising services or other factors. In order to compete, we need to improve our brand recognition and our selling efforts internationally and build stronger relationships with advertisers. We also need to
better 
41 
Table of Contents
understand our international users and their preferences. If we fail to do so, our global expansion efforts may be more costly and less profitable than we
expect.  Our business may be adversely affected by malicious applications that interfere with, or exploit security flaws in, our
products and services.  Our business may be adversely affected by malicious applications that make changes to our users'
computers and interfere with the Google experience. These applications have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to change our users' internet experience, including hijacking queries to Google.com, altering or replacing Google
search results, or otherwise interfering with our ability to connect with our users. The interference often occurs without disclosure to or consent from users, resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with Google. These
applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable, may reinstall themselves and may circumvent other applications' efforts to block or remove them. In addition, we offer a number of products and services that our users
download to their computers or that they rely on to store information and transmit information to others over the internet. These products and services are subject to attack by viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, which could
jeopardize the security of information stored in a user's computer or in our computer systems and networks. The ability to reach users and provide them with a superior experience is critical to our success. If our efforts to combat these
malicious applications are unsuccessful, or if our products and services have actual or perceived vulnerabilities, our reputation may be harmed and our user traffic could decline, which would damage our business.  Proprietary document formats may limit the effectiveness of our search technology by preventing our technology from accessing the content of
documents in such formats, which could limit the effectiveness of our products and services.  A large amount of information on the
internet is provided in proprietary document formats such as Microsoft Word. The providers of the software application used to create these documents could engineer the document format to prevent or interfere with our ability to access the document
contents with our search technology. This would mean that the document contents would not be included in our search results even if the contents were directly relevant to a search. The software providers may also seek to require us to pay them
royalties in exchange for giving us the ability to search documents in their format. If the software provider also competes with us in the search business, they may give their search technology a preferential ability to search documents in their
proprietary format. Any of these results could harm our brand and our operating results.  New technologies could block our ads, which
would harm our business.  Technologies may be developed that can block the display of our ads. Most of our revenues are derived from
fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages. As a result, ad-blocking technology could, in the future, adversely affect our operating results.  If we fail to detect click fraud or other invalid clicks, we could face additional litigation as well as lose the confidence of our advertisers,
which would cause our business to suffer.  We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks and other invalid clicks on our ads from
a variety of potential sources. We have regularly refunded fees that our advertisers have paid to us that were later attributed to click fraud and other invalid clicks, and we expect to do so in the future. Invalid clicks are clicks that we have
determined are not intended by the user to link to the underlying content, such as inadvertent clicks on the same ad twice and clicks resulting from click fraud. Click fraud occurs when a user intentionally clicks on a Google AdWords ad displayed on
a web site for a reason other than to view the underlying content. If we are unable to stop these invalid clicks, these refunds may increase. If we find new evidence of past invalid clicks we may issue refunds retroactively of amounts previously
paid to our Google Network members. This would negatively affect our profitability, and these invalid clicks could hurt our brand. If invalid clicks are not detected, the affected advertisers may experience a reduced return on their investment in
our advertising programs because the invalid clicks will not lead to potential revenue for the advertisers. This could lead the advertisers to become dissatisfied with our advertising programs, which has led to litigation alleging click fraud and
could lead to further litigation, as well as to a loss of advertisers and revenues.  Index spammers could harm the integrity of our
web search results, which could damage our reputation and cause our users to be dissatisfied with our products and services.  There
is an ongoing and increasing effort by index spammers to develop ways to manipulate our web search results. For example, because our web search technology ranks a web page's relevance based in part on the importance of the web sites
that link to it, people have attempted to link a group of web sites together to manipulate web search results. We take this problem very seriously because providing relevant information to users is critical to our success. If our efforts to combat
these and other types of index spamming are unsuccessful, our reputation for delivering relevant information could be diminished. This could result in a decline in user traffic, which would damage our business.

If we were to lose the services of Eric, Larry, Sergey or other members of our senior management
team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.  Our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of
key members of our senior management team. In particular, our CEO, Eric Schmidt, and our founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are critical to the overall management of Google as well as the development of our technology, our culture and our
strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business.
We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, we may
not be able to grow effectively.  Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our
future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our
competitors have directly targeted our employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.  We have in the past maintained a rigorous, highly selective and time-consuming hiring process. We believe that our approach to hiring has significantly
contributed to our success to date. As we grow, our hiring process may prevent us from hiring the personnel we need in a timely manner. In addition, as we become a more mature company, we may find our recruiting efforts more challenging. The
incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees provided by our equity award grants may not be as effective as in the past. In addition, our other current and future compensation arrangements, which include cash bonuses and our TSO program, may
not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. If we do not succeed in attracting excellent personnel or retaining or motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.
We have a short operating history and a relatively new business model in an emerging and rapidly evolving market. This makes it
difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not continue to be successful.  We first derived
revenue from our online search business in 1999 and from our advertising services in 2000, and we have only a short operating history with our cost-per-click advertising model, which we launched in 2002 and our cost-per-impression advertising model
which we launched in the second quarter of 2005. As a result, we have little operating history to aid in assessing our future prospects. Also, we derive nearly all of our revenues from online advertising, which is an immature industry that has
undergone rapid and dramatic changes in its short history. We will encounter risks and difficulties as a company operating in a new and rapidly evolving market. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could
materially harm our business and operating results.  More individuals are using non-PC devices to access the internet. If users of
these devices do not widely adopt versions of our web search technology developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.  The number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart phones and handheld computers and video game consoles,
as well as television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality and memory associated with alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more
difficult. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device users to our web search services or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with non-PC communications devices, we will
fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business.  We may have difficulty scaling and adapting our existing architecture to accommodate increased traffic and technology advances or changing business requirements, which could lead to the loss of users,
advertisers and Google Network members, and cause us to incur expenses to make architectural changes.  To be successful, our network
infrastructure has to perform well and be reliable. The greater the user traffic and the greater the complexity of our products and services, the more computing power we will need. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on
the purchase and lease of data centers and equipment and the upgrade of our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our web sites and to roll out new products and services. This expansion is expensive and complex and
could result in inefficiencies or operational failures. If we do not expand successfully, or if we experience inefficiencies and operational failures, the quality of our products and services and our users' experience could decline. This could
damage our reputation and lead us to lose current and potential users, advertisers and Google Network members. Cost increases, loss of traffic or failure to accommodate new technologies or changing business requirements could harm our operating
results and financial condition.

We rely on bandwidth providers, data centers and others in providing products and services to our
users, and any failure or interruption in the services and products provided by these third parties could damage our reputation and harm our ability to operate our business.  We rely on vendors, including data center and bandwidth providers in providing products and services to our users. Any disruption in the network access or
colocation services provided by these providers or any failure of these providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties our providers face may have negative effects on
our business. We exercise little control over these vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We license technology and related databases to facilitate aspects of our data center and connectivity
operations including internet traffic management services. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service and availability for such elements. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays in connection
with these technologies and information services could harm our relationship with users, adversely affect our brand and expose us to liabilities.  Our systems are also heavily reliant on the availability of electricity. If we were to experience a major power outage, we would have to rely on back-up generators. These back-up generators may not operate properly and their fuel supply
could be inadequate during a major power outage. This could result in a disruption of our business.  Our business depends on
continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users
and advertisers.  Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products
require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable
companies and mobile communications companies. Some of these providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their
infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. These activities may be permitted in the U.S. after recent regulatory changes, including recent decisions by the U.S.
Supreme Court and Federal Communications Commission. While interference with access to our popular products and services seems unlikely, such carrier interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers and increased costs, and
could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenue and growth.  Interruption or failure of
our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.  The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Any damage to
or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our brand. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power
loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to
break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for
all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our
service.  Our business depends on increasing use of the internet by users searching for information, advertisers marketing products
and services and web sites seeking to earn revenue to support their web content. If the internet infrastructure does not grow and is not maintained to support these activities, our business will be harmed.  Our success will depend on the continued growth and maintenance of the internet infrastructure. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone
with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet services. Internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it if the number of internet users continues to increase, or if existing or future
internet users access the internet more often or increase their bandwidth requirements. In addition, viruses, worms and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet. The internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as
a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure, and could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as our ability to provide our solutions.  Payments to certain of our Google Network members have exceeded the related fees we receive from our advertisers.  We are obligated under certain agreements to make non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google Network members based on their
achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. In these agreements, we promise to make these minimum payments to the Google Network member for a pre-negotiated period of 
44 
Table of Contents
time. At March31, 2008, our aggregate outstanding non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share commitments totaled $1.60 billion through 2012
compared to $1.75 billion at December31, 2007. It is difficult to forecast with certainty the fees that we will earn under agreements with guarantees, and sometimes the fees we earn fall short of the guaranteed minimum payment amounts.
We rely on outside providers for our worldwide billing, collection, payment processing and payroll. If these outside service
providers are not able to fulfill their service obligations, our business and operations could be disrupted, and our operating results could be harmed.  Outside providers perform various functions for us, such as worldwide billing, collection, payment processing and payroll. These functions are critical to our operations and involve sensitive interactions between us
and our advertisers, partners (e.g., Google Network members) and employees. Although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls, if we do not successfully manage our service providers or if the service
providers do not perform satisfactorily to agreed-upon service levels, our operations could be disrupted resulting in advertiser, partner or employee dissatisfaction. In addition, our business, reputation and operating results could be adversely
affected.  To the extent our revenues are paid in foreign currencies, and currency exchange rates become unfavorable, we may lose
some of the economic value of the revenues in U.S. dollar terms.  As we expand our international operations, more of our customers
may pay us in foreign currencies. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the currency exchange rates were to change unfavorably, the value of net receivables we receive in
foreign currencies and later convert to U.S. dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. Hedging strategies, such as forward contracts, options and foreign exchange
swaps related to transaction exposures, that we have implemented or may implement to mitigate this risk may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Additionally, hedging programs expose us to risks that could adversely affect
our operating results, including the following:  
We may have
exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.  Our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower
than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax
laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review could have a negative effect on our operating
results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for
which such determination is made.  Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock  The trading price for our ClassA common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.  The trading price of our ClassA common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering and will likely continue to be volatile. The
trading price of our ClassA common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:  
45 
Table of Contents
In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our ClassA common stock,
regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these
companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.  We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.  We have never declared or paid any
cash dividend on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.  The concentration of our capital stock ownership with our founders, executive officers and our directors and their affiliates will limit our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters. 
Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our ClassA common stock has one vote per share. As of March31, 2008, our
founders, executive officers and directors (and their affiliates) together owned shares of ClassA common stock, Class B common stock and other equity interests representing approximately 71% of the voting power of our outstanding capital
stock. In particular, as of March31, 2008, our two founders and our CEO, Larry, Sergey and Eric, owned approximately 89% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 68% of the voting power of our outstanding capital
stock. Larry, Sergey and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other
sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control limits our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a
result, the market price of our ClassA common stock could be adversely affected.  Provisions in our charter documents and under
Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.  Provisions in our certificate of incorporation
and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:  
46 
Table of Contents
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a
business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware
law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.  
Results of Google's Transferable Stock Option Program  Under our TSO program, which we launched in April 2007,
eligible employees are able to sell vested stock options to participating financial institutions in an online auction as an alternative to exercising options in the traditional method and selling the underlying shares. The following table provides
