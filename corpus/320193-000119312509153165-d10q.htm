Apple Inc.  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) design, manufacture,
and market personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sell a variety of related software, third-party digital content and applications, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells
its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod, and iPhone compatible
products including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB),
education, enterprise, government, and creative markets.  Basis of Presentation and Preparation  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for all periods presented. The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  Certain prior year amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company reclassified
$2.4billion of certain fixed-income securities from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in the September27, 2008 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The reclassification resulted from a change in
accounting presentation for certain investments based on contractual maturity dates, which more closely reflects the Company's assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. As a result of this change, marketable
securities with maturities less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. There have been no changes in the Company's investment policies or
practices associated with this change in accounting presentation. See Note 2, Financial Instruments of this Form 10-Q for additional information.  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended
September27, 2008, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2008 Form 10-K). Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated
quarters of those fiscal years.  In May 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.165, Subsequent Events, which established general accounting standards and disclosure for subsequent events.The Company adopted SFAS No.165 during the third quarter of 2009. In
accordance with SFAS No.165, the Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date and time the financial statements were issued on July22, 2009.  Earnings Per Common Share  Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available
to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include
outstanding options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, and unvested restricted stock units (RSUs). The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.  
5 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the
three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):  
Potentially dilutive securities representing approximately 10.5million and 8.4million
shares of common stock for the three months ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008, respectively, and 13.4million and 9.2million shares of common stock for the nine months ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008,
respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive.  Fair Value Measurements  During the third quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
No.107 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) 28-1, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual financial statements. The
adoption of FSP No.107 and APB 28-1 had no financial impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
SFAS No.157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various other accounting pronouncements. The adoption of SFAS No.157 did not have a material effect on the
Company's financial condition or operating results.  SFAS No.157 establishes a hierarchy for information and valuations used in
measuring fair value, which is broken down into three levels. Level 1 valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 valuations are based on inputs that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, other than quoted prices included within Level 1. Level 3 valuations are based on information that is unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  The Company also adopted SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilitiesincluding an amendment of FASB Statement No.115, during the
first quarter of 2009. SFAS No.159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No.159 requires that unrealized
gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. The Company adopted SFAS No.159 but has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.
Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on the adoption of FSP No.107 and
SFAS Nos. 157 and 159.  
6 
Financial Instruments  During the third quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments, which provide operational guidance
for determining other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results.   During the second quarter of 2009, the Company adopted SFAS No.161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan
amendment of FASB Statement No.133, which requires additional disclosures about the Company's objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and related interpretations, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No.161 had
no financial impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Refer to Note 2, Financial Instruments
of this Form 10-Q for additional information on the adoption of FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 and SFAS No.161.  Note 2  Financial
Instruments  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's cash and available-for-sale securities held in its marketable securities investment portfolio, recorded as cash, cash equivalents, short-term or
long-term marketable securities as of June27, 2009 and September27, 2008 (in millions):  
7 
As of December27, 2008, the Company changed its accounting presentation for certain fixed-income
investments, which resulted in the reclassification of certain investments from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities. As a result, prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period's
presentation. The Company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument's underlying contractual maturity date, while its prior classifications were based on the nature of the securities and
their availability for use in current operations. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified
as long-term. The Company's long-term marketable securities' maturities range from one year to five years. The Company believes this new presentation is preferable as it more closely reflects the Company's assessment of the timing of
when such securities will be converted to cash. Accordingly, certain fixed-income investments totaling $2.4billion have been reclassified from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in the September27, 2008
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the current period's financial statement presentation. There have been no changes in the Company's investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting presentation.
The following tables summarize the Company's available-for-sale securities' adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains, gross
unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment category as of June27, 2009 and September27, 2008 (in millions):  
The Company had net unrealized gains on its investment portfolio of $20 million as of
June27, 2009 and net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio of $117 million as of September27, 2008. The net unrealized gains as of June27, 2009 related primarily to short-term marketable securities, while the net unrealized
losses as of September27, 2008 related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its 
8 
marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The
Company recognized no material net gains or losses during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 related to such sales.  The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value for investments in an unrealized loss position as of June27, 2009 and September27, 2008, aggregated by investment category and the
length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):  
The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment
portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Company's marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. The Company typically invests in highly-rated
securities, and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value
has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company's intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the
investment's amortized cost basis. During the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008, the Company did not recognize any material impairment charges on outstanding securities. As of June27, 2009, the
Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and
option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities. To help
protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company's subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Company's
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currencies. The Company typically hedges
portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the
Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward
and option contracts to partially offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign
exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting 
9 
considerations, and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of
the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange rates. As of the end of the third quarter of 2009, the general nature of the Company's risk management activities and the general nature and mix of the Company's derivative
financial instruments have not changed materially from the end of 2008.  The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are
based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments in accordance with SFAS No.133. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded
in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Derivatives that are not
designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense.  The Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $37 million and $19 million, net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of June27, 2009
and September27, 2008, respectively. Other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other
comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. The portion of the Company's net deferred gain related to products
under subscription accounting is expected to be recorded in earnings ratably over the related products' estimated economic lives beginning when the hedged transactions occur, while the portion of the net deferred gain related to other products
is expected to be recorded in earnings at the time the hedged transactions occur. As of June27, 2009, the hedged transactions are expected to occur within six months.  Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period
or within a subsequent two month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in
fair value of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any material net gains related to the loss of hedge designation on
discontinued cash flow hedges during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008, respectively.  The
Company had an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of $6 million and $1 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as of June27, 2009
and September27, 2008, respectively. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense.  The Company recognized in earnings a net loss of $34 million and a net gain of $139 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts not
designated as hedging instruments in accordance with SFAS No.133 during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009, respectively.  The following table shows the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Company's derivative instruments outstanding as of June27, 2009 (in millions):  
10 
The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume
outstanding as of June27, 2009, and do not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if
all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates.
Although the table above reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange
instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of
the instruments.  The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market
information as of June27, 2009. Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements of this Form 10-Q, for additional information on the fair value measurements for all financial assets and liabilities, including derivative assets and
derivative liabilities, that are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements on a recurring basis. The following table shows the Company's derivative instruments measured at gross fair value as reflected in the
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June27, 2009 (in millions):  
The following tables show the effect of the Company's derivative instruments designated as cash flow and net investment hedges in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 (in millions):  
11 
Note 3  Fair Value Measurements  During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted SFAS No.157 for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis. SFAS No.157 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When
determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk
measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit risk.  SFAS No.157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the
fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. SFAS No.157 establishes and prioritizes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs
that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Note 5  Income Taxes  As of June27, 2009, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $680 million, of which $282 million, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate. As of September27, 2008,
the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $506 million, of which $253 million, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate. The Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as other
non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had $283 million and $219 million of gross interest and penalties accrued as of June27, 2009 and September27, 2008, respectively, which are classified as
other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  On May27, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling in the case of Xilinx,Inc. v. Commissioner, holding that stock-based compensation is required to be included in certain transfer pricing arrangements between a U.S. company and its offshore
subsidiary.As a result of the ruling in this case, the Company increased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $79 million and decreased shareholders' equity by approximately $72 million in the third quarter of
2009.  Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits
by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12months.  Note 6  Shareholders' Equity  Preferred Stock  The Company has five million shares
of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.  
15 
Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries whose functional currency
is not the U.S. dollar, the effective portion of foreign currency net investment hedges, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments
accounted for as cash flow hedges.  The following table summarizes the components of total comprehensive income, net of taxes, during the
three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 (in millions):  
The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives, net
of taxes, held by the Company during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 (in millions):

Employee Benefit Plans  Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans  As of July17, 2009, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Ronald B. Johnson, Peter
Oppenheimer, Philip W. Schiller, and Bertrand Serlet have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities 
16 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or
formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's employee stock purchase plan
and upon vesting of RSUs.  Stock Option Activity  Historically, the Company used equity awards in the form of stock options as one of the means for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent. Beginning in 2009, the Company changed its equity compensation program
for eligible employees to RSUs as the primary type of long-term equity-based award. A summary of the Company's stock option and RSU activity and related information for the nine months ended June27, 2009 is as follows (in thousands,
except per share amounts and contractual term in years):  
Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on the
last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative
intrinsic value. The total intrinsic value of options at the time of exercise was $218 million and $367 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009, respectively, and $584 million and $1.7 billion for the three- and
nine-month periods ended June28, 2008, respectively.  RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the
Company's stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added back to the shares available for grant under the Company's stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the
number of RSUs cancelled.  Restricted Stock Units  The Company's Board of Directors has granted RSUs to members of the Company's executive management team, excluding its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), as well as various employees within the
Company. Beginning in 2009, the Company changed its equity compensation program for eligible employees to RSUs as the primary type of long-term equity-based award. RSUs generally vest over four years either at the end of the four-year service
period, in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, in equal installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date, or in equal installments on each semi-annual anniversary of the
grant date. Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock.  
17 
Outstanding RSU balances were not included in the outstanding options balances in the preceding table. A
summary of the Company's RSU activity and related information for the nine months ended June27, 2009 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):  
The fair value as of the vesting date of RSUs that vested was $98 million and $186 million for the
three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009, respectively. There were no RSUs that vested during the three months ended June28, 2008. RSUs that vested during the nine months ended June28, 2008 had a fair value of $300 million
as of the vesting date.  Note 7  Stock-Based Compensation  SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)
option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards.The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life, and interest rates.The expected volatility is based on the
historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options
on the Company's common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date
based on the award's fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  The compensation expense incurred by the Company for RSUs is based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and is amortized ratably on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period.  The weighted-average assumptions used for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27,
2009 and June28, 2008 and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) during those periods are as follows:  
18 
The following table provides a summary of the stock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended
June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 (in millions):  
Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as part of software development costs was not
significant as of June27, 2009 and September27, 2008. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $199 million and $331 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009, respectively, and
was $55 million and $139 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended June28, 2008, respectively. As of June27, 2009, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.5
billion, which the Company expects to recognize over its weighted-average vesting period of 2.7 years.  Note 8  Commitments and Contingencies 
Lease Commitments  The Company leases
various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The Company's major facility leases are
generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 years. Leases for retail space are generally for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal
options. As of September27, 2008, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $1.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion related to leases for retail space. As of June27, 2009, total future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases related to leases for retail space was $1.4 billion.  Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications
The following table reconciles changes in the Company's accrued warranties and related costs for the three- and nine-month periods
ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 (in millions):  
The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application
software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or
19 
damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any
significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to
indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either June27, 2009 or September27, 2008.
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures,
certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to
significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including, but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and certain LCDs, are subject at
times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and
LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company
remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results.  The Company and other participants in the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand
for their products. In addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize
custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist
until the suppliers' yields have matured. If the Company's supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a
key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be
adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,
or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.  Significant portions of the Company's Mac computers, iPods, iPhones, logic boards, and other assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of
Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Company's outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of
components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Company's key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable Mac computers, iPods, iPhones and most of the Company's iMacs.
Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The
Company's purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.  Long-Term Supply Agreements
The Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. During the first
quarter of 2009, a long-term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the Company. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company made a prepayment of $500million to
LG Display for the purchase of LCD panels. As of June27, 2009, the Company had a total of $759 million of inventory component prepayments outstanding.  Subsequent to June27, 2009, the Company entered into a four-year supply agreement with Toshiba to purchase NAND flash memory. As part of the agreement, the Company made a prepayment of $500million in the
fourth quarter of 2009.  
20 
Contingencies  The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated, which are discussed in Part II, Item1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading
Legal Proceedings. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return
product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various
countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws,
there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results.  Note 9  Segment Information and Geographic Data  In accordance with SFAS No.131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making
decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.  The Company manages its business primarily on
a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail, and FileMaker operations. The
Company's reportable operating segments consist of Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail operations. Other operating segments include Asia Pacific, which encompasses Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's FileMaker, Inc.
subsidiary. The Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific segments exclude activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle
East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers.
The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2008 Form
10-K.  The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic
segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Company's retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the
Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $101 million and $202 million during the three- and nine-month periods
ended June27, 2009, respectively, and $113 million and $251 million during the three- and nine-month periods ended June28, 2008, respectively.  
21 
The Company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues
to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company's more typical
retail stores. The Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is
based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 11 high-profile stores as of June27, 2009. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing
resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $17 million and $49 million during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009, respectively, and $13 million and $37 million during the three- and nine-month periods ended
June28, 2008, respectively.  Summary information by operating segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009
and June28, 2008 is as follows (in millions):  
A reconciliation of the Company's segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 is as

22 
Note 10  Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions  The Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr.Jobs in the operation
of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Company did not recognize any expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during the three months ended June27, 2009 and recognized a total of $4,000 in expenses pursuant to the
Reimbursement Agreement during the nine months ended June27, 2009. The Company recognized a total of $102,000 and $682,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during the three- and nine-month periods ended June28, 2008,
respectively. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company's products and
services include the Mac line of desktop and portable computers, the iPod line of portable digital music players, iPhone
, Apple TV, Xserve, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales
force, and third-party wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers,
headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB), education, enterprise, government, and creative markets. A further
description of the Company's products may be found below under the heading Products and Part II, Item1A, Risk Factors, as well as in Part I, Item1, Business, of the Company's 2008 Form 10-K.
The Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government and creative
customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles and work environments. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer, including the
hardware, operating system, and sophisticated software applications. Additionally, the Company controls the design and development of hardware and system software for its portable digital music players and mobile communication devices, and hosts a
robust platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications for these devices through the iTunes Store. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle and
productivity solutions, which are further enhanced by the Company's emphasis on ease-of-use and creative industrial designs.  The
Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers, consumer electronics with its iPod product families, mobile communications with iPhone, and distribution of third-party
digital content and applications through its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronics markets as well as a 
24 
leader in the emerging market for distribution of third-party digital content and applications, these markets are highly competitive and subject to
aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Company's
research and development spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of personal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software
applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.  The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated
products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on Mac computers, and demonstrate the
compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality
buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 258 stores
open as of June27, 2009.  The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant
Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac computers and
other products over those of its competitors.The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its direct sales force.  The Company's iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. iPods can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores,
large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above.  iPhone is distributed
through the Company, its cellular network carriers' distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers in over 80 countries. The Company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to
distribute and provide cellular network services for iPhones. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Spain, Ireland, and certain other countries.  Products  The Company offers a range of personal
computing products including desktop and portable personal computers, related devices and peripherals, and various third-party hardware and software products. In addition, the Company offers its own software products, including Mac OS X, the
Company's proprietary operating system software for the Mac; server software and related solutions; professional application software; and consumer, education, and business oriented application software. The Company also designs, develops, and
markets its family of iPod digital music players and its iPhone mobile communication devices, along with related accessories and services, including the online distribution of third-party digital content through the Company's iTunes Store.
In June 2009, the Company introduced updates to its MacBook Pro family of portable computers and released Safari 4, a new version of the Company's web browser. In June 2009, the Company also announced its next version of the Mac operating system, Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow
Leopard, which is expected to be available in September 2009.  In June 2009, the Company introduced iPhone 3GS, the third-generation iPhone that combines the features of iPhone 3G with longer battery life, a built-in three megapixel auto-focus camera, video
recording, hands free voice control, and the new iPhone 3.0 software, which is also available for download on prior iPhone models. iPhone 3.0 software includes new features, such as Cut, Copy and Paste, Spotlight Search and MMS messaging. Certain
features of the iPhone 3.0 software are not supported by some of iPhone's cellular network carriers.  A detailed discussion of the
Company's other products may be found in Part I, Item2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of the Company's first and second quarter 2009 Form 10-Qs and in Part I,
Item1, Business, of the Company's 2008 Form 10-K.  
25 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial
condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2008 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.  Management believes the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of marketable securities, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase
commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these critical policies because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and
operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and
Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition  Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, third-party digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts.
The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
No.03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software, (e.g., Mac computers, iPod portable digital music players and iPhone) pursuant to
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No.97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. For products that are not software or software-related, (e.g., third-party
digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories), the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.104, Revenue Recognition. 
The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is
shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on
these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and
all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.  For both Apple TV and iPhone, the Company has indicated that from time-to-time
it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Therefore, sales of Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP No.97-2. The Company
recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. If the Company's estimated economic life of
a product accounted for under subscription accounting changes, the future rate at which deferred revenue and deferred costs are amortized into the Company's results of operations will change. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering,
sales, marketing, and warranty are expensed as incurred.  The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to
price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated
amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue 
26 
recognition have been met. The Company's policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable
estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered.
The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs
and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers
who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required
to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations.  Valuation of Marketable
Securities  The Company's investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses
related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of investments impact the
Company's net income only when such investments are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security's cost basis. The
Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge
in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any
changes thereto, and the Company's intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment's amortized cost basis. The Company's assessment on whether an
investment is other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The Company distributes its products through third-party
distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with
third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end
customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or
credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based on management's assessment of the ability to collect specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit-worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the
specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic
environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information
related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect
earnings in the period the adjustments are made.  Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories
of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that
considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. 
27 
The personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component
obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be
required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were recorded.  The Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of
purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in
demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would
negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.  Warranty Costs  The Company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and
projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy
of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No.97-2,
the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the Company's results
of operations.  The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software's
compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to
such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts
for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. Under the provisions of SFAS No.123R, stock-based compensation cost is
estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The
BSM option-pricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. Significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock-based awards
granted in the future.   Income Taxes  The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the
asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating
losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The
Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.  The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109, whereby the Company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement.  
28 
Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be
generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of
the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities
involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of FIN 48 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material
impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Legal and Other Contingencies  As discussed in Part II, Item1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Note 8 Commitments and
Contingencies in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No.5, Accounting for
Contingencies, the Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an
exposure can be reasonably estimated. In management's opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of
these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Net Sales  The following table summarizes net sales and Mac unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 (in millions, except unit
sales in thousands and per unit amounts):  
30 
Net sales during the third quarter of 2009 and the first nine months of 2009 increased $873 million or
12% and $2.1 billion or 8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008. Several factors contributed positively to these increases, including the following:  
Partially offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, net sales during
the third quarter of 2009 and the first nine months of 2009 were negatively impacted by certain factors, including the following:  
Net
sales of Mac portable systems decreased by 2%, while unit sales increased by 13% for the third quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The decline in net sales of Mac portable systems during the third quarter of 2009 was attributable to
lower average selling prices, a shift in product mix towards lower-priced portables and a stronger U.S. dollar. During the first nine months of 2009, Mac portable systems net sales and unit sales increased by 3% and 14%, respectively, compared to
the same period in 2008, due primarily to higher sales of MacBooks, which experienced double digit growth in net sales and unit sales in each of the Company's reportable operating segments compared to the same period in 2008.  
31 
Net sales and unit sales of the Company's Mac desktop systems decreased by 18% and
10%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2009, and decreased 24% and 14%, respectively, during the first nine months of 2009. The decrease in net sales of Mac desktop systems for the third quarter of 2009 and the first nine months of 2009 was
due mainly to a stronger U.S. dollar and a shift in product mix towards lower-priced desktops.  
Segment Operating Performance  The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's
reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South
America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the
Retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services.  Americas  Net sales in the Americas segment during the third quarter of 2009 increased $392 million or 11% compared to the same period in 2008, and Americas Mac
unit sales increased by 1% year-over-year. The increase in net sales during the third quarter of 2009 was attributable to increased iPhone revenue and higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, which were
offset partially by a decrease in sales of Mac desktop and portable systems and iPods. Mac net sales decreased due largely to lower average selling prices across all Mac products and a shift in product mix toward lower-priced Macs. The Americas
segment represented 46% of the Company's total net sales in the third quarters of both 2009 and 2008.  During the first nine months of
2009, net sales in the Americas segment increased $844 million or 8% compared to the same period in 2008, while Americas Mac unit sales were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. The increase in net sales during the first nine months of 2009
was attributable primarily to the significant year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue, higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, and increased sales of Mac portable systems, which were partially offset by
a decrease in sales of Mac desktop systems and iPods. The Americas segment represented approximately 44% and 45% of the Company's total net sales for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Europe  Net sales in Europe increased $358 million or
22% during the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008. The key contributors to this growth were iPhone revenue and sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, which was offset partially by lower
year-over-year net sales of Mac desktop and portable systems and iPods. During the third quarter of 2009, total Mac unit sales increased 9% year-over-year, while total Mac net sales decreased resulting from lower average selling prices across all
Mac products, a shift in product mix to lower-priced Macs and a stronger U.S. dollar.  For the first nine months of 2009, net sales and Mac
unit sales in Europe increased 17% and 9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008. The increase in net sales was due mainly to increased iPhone revenue, strong sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store,
and Mac portable systems, which were offset partially by lower net sales of Mac desktop systems and iPods. Mac unit sales increased due primarily to strong demand for MacBook, while total Mac net sales decreased due to lower average selling prices
across all Mac products, a shift in product mix to lower-priced Macs and a stronger U.S. dollar during the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.  
32 
Japan  Japan's net sales increased $51 million or 14% during the third quarter of 2009 and increased $208 million or 17% during the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008. The key contributors to Japan's net sales
growth for the third quarter of 2009 were increased iPhone revenue, strength in the Japanese Yen, strong demand for certain Mac portable systems, and strong sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, partially
offset by decreased sales of Mac desktop systems and iPods. Japan's net sales growth for the first nine months of 2009 was attributable to increased iPhone revenue, strength in the Japanese Yen, Mac portable sales, sales of third-party digital
content and applications from the iTunes Store, and iPods, which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of Mac desktop systems. Net sales and unit sales of Mac portable systems increased during the third quarter of 2009 and first nine months
of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008, driven predominantly by stronger demand for 13-inch Mac portable systems.  Retail  Retail net sales increased $51 million or 4% during the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter in 2008. The increase in net sales was due
predominantly to increased iPhone revenue, partially offset by a decrease in sales of iPods and Macs. Retail Mac net sales decreased due to lower average selling prices across all Mac products and shift in product mix to lower-priced Macs. The
Company opened six new retail store during the third quarter of 2009, ending the quarter with 258 stores open, compared to 216 stores open at the end of the third quarter of 2008. The year-over-year growth rate of Retail net sales was less than the
increase in the average number of stores open during the same period, which the Company believes reflects the challenging consumer-spending environment and continued third-party channel expansion. As a result, with an average of 254 stores and 211
stores open during the third quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively, average revenue per store declined to $5.9 million for the third quarter of 2009 from $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Retail net sales grew $110 million or 2% during the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, due primarily to increased iPhone
revenue, which was offset partially by a decrease in sales of iPods and a product mix shift to lower-priced Macs. Average revenue per store decreased to $18.7 million for the first nine months of 2009 based on an average of 252 stores, down from
$22.4 million in the first nine months of 2008 based on an average of 205 stores.  The Retail segment reported operating income of $321
million during the third quarter of 2009 compared to operating income of $297 million during the third quarter of 2008, and reported operating income of $982 million during the first nine months of 2009 compared to $1.0 billion during the first nine
months of 2008. The increase in operating income during the third quarter of 2009 was due to an improvement in the total Company gross margin, and the operating income decrease during the first nine months of 2009 was attributable primarily to lower
average revenue per store.  Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed
assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled $1.6 billion through the end of the third quarter of
2009. As of June27, 2009, the Retail segment had approximately 15,600 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding lease commitments associated with retail space of $1.4 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to
close multiple retail stores and such costs could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Other Segments 
The Company's Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $21
million or 4% during the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008, which was due primarily to increased iPhone revenue, offset partially by declines in sales of iPods and Mac desktop and portable systems. During the first nine
months of 2009, net sales in the Company's Other Segments decreased by $54 million or 3% compared to the same period in 2008. This decrease was related primarily to lower net sales of most iPods, Mac desktop and portable systems, and as well as
a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and other Asian currencies, which were offset partially by increased iPhone revenue in the Company's Asia Pacific region.  
33 
Gross Margin  Gross margin for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 was as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):  
The gross margin percentage for the third quarter of 2009 was 36.3% compared to 34.8% for the
third quarter of 2008 and the gross margin percentage for the first nine months of 2009 was 35.7% compared to 34.2% for the first nine months of 2008. The gross margin percentage for the third quarter of 2009 and the first nine months of 2009
increased largely as a result of significantly lower commodity and other product costs and a stronger U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by product price reductions.  The Company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and the first nine months of 2009 and anticipates gross margin levels of
about 34% in the fourth quarter of 2009. This expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential
future cost increases for key components, and a stronger U.S. dollar.  The foregoing statements regarding the Company's expected gross
margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in Part II, Item1A, Risk Factors under the subheading
Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities, which is
incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors,
including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND
flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company's sales mix towards
products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the
Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company's significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in
the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 were as follows (in millions, except for percentages):  
34 
Research and Development (RD)  Expenditures for RD increased 17% or $49 million to $341 million in the three months ended June27, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, and increased 20% or $164 million to $975
million during the nine months ended June27, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. These increases were due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expenses and an increase in RD headcount in the current year to support expanded
RD activities. In addition, $19 million and $64 million of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard and excluded from RD expense during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27,
2009, respectively, while no software development costs were capitalized during the same periods of 2008. Although total RD expense increased 17% and 20% during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009, respectively, it
remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the revenue growth of 12% and 8%, respectively, during the same periods in 2008. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in RD are critical to its future growth and
competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in RD to
remain competitive.  Selling, General, and Administrative (SGA)  SGA expenditures increased $94 million or 10% and $324 million or 12%, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008.
These increases are due primarily to the Company's continued expansion of its Retail segment, higher stock-based compensation expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising.  Other Income and Expense  Total other income and
expense decreased $58 million or 49% to $60 million during the three months ended June27, 2009 compared to $118 million in the same period of 2008, and decreased $199 million or 41% during the nine months ended June27, 2009 compared to
the same period in 2008. The overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the decline in interest rates during the first nine months of 2009 compared to the first nine months of 2008, partially offset by the Company's higher
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased to 1.11% in the third quarter of 2009 from 2.66% in the third
quarter of 2008.  The Company's investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of $45 million and $121 million as of June27,
2009 and September27, 2008, respectively, which was offset by gross unrealized gains of $65 million and $4 million as of June27, 2009 and September27, 2008, respectively. The net unrealized gains as of June27, 2009 related
primarily to short-term marketable securities while the net unrealized losses as of September27, 2008 related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities
investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Company's marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically widening credit spreads. The Company does not have the intent
to sell, nor is it more likely than not the Company will be required to sell, an investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Accordingly,no declines in fair value were recognized in the Company's Condensed Statements of
Operations during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008.The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit
deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 related to such sales.  Provision for Income Taxes  The Company's
effective tax rates were 29% and 30% for the three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009, respectively, and 29% and 30% for the three- and nine-month periods ended June28, 2008, respectively. The Company's effective rate for
these periods differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the
years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to
audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. 
35 
However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not
consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted SFAS No.157, Fair Value
Measurements, which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-2,
Effective Date of FASB Statement No.157. FSPNo. 157-2 delays the effective date of SFASNo.157 to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for
items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the
application of FSP No.157-2, management does not currently believe adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results.  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how
an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS No.141R also establishes principles
around how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination.
In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 141R-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination that Arise from Contingencies, which amends SFAS No.141R to require that assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, in accordance with SFAS No.157, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. If the fair value of the contingency cannot be
determined during the measurement period, FSP No. FAS 141R-1 requires the contingency be recognized in accordance with SFAS No.5 and FASB Interpretation (FIN) No.14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss, if it
meets the criteria for recognition in that guidance. SFAS No.141R and FSP No. FAS 141R-1 are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2010.
Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No.141R and FSP No. FAS 141R-1, management does not currently believe adoption of these accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company's
financial condition or operating results.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of June27, 2009 and September27, 2008 (in millions):  
As of June27, 2009, the Company had $31.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable
securities, an increase of $6.6 billion from September27, 2008. The principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $7.0 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property,
plant, and equipment of $685 million. The Company's cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the increase in deferred revenue, net of deferred costs, associated with subscription accounting
for iPhone.  The Company's marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities with a minimum
rating of single-A. As of June27, 2009 and September27, 2008, $15.5 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally
based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, and
other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.  
36 
Capital Assets  The Company's cash payments for capital asset purchases were $685 million during the first nine months of 2009, consisting of approximately $202 million for Retail store facilities and $483 million for corporate
facilities and infrastructure, including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $1.2 billion for capital asset purchases during 2009, including approximately $360 million for Retail facilities and
approximately $840 million for corporate facilities and infrastructure.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained
interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.  Lease Commitments  As of September27, 2008, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and
related facilities. The Company's major facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 years. Leases for retail space are generally for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of
which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of June27, 2009, total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases related to leases of retail space was $1.4 billion.  Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers  The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual
suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the
Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to
SOP No.97-2 whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of June27, 2009, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component purchase commitments, and estimated warranty
commitments of $3.5 billion.  The Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory
components. During the first quarter of 2009, a long-term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the Company. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company made a
prepayment of $500million to LG Display for the purchase of LCD panels. As of June27, 2009, the Company had a total of $759 million of inventory component prepayments outstanding.  Subsequent to June27, 2009, the Company entered into a four-year supply agreement with Toshiba to purchase NAND flash memory. As part of the agreement, the Company made a prepayment of
$500million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Asset Retirement Obligations  The Company's asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of June27,
2009, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of approximately $32 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.  Other
Obligations  Other outstanding obligations were approximately $266 million as of June27, 2009, primarily related to advertising,
research and development, Internet and telecommunications services, and other obligations.  
37 
As of June27, 2009, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $680 million and an
additional $283 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax
benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12months. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit
outcomes.  Indemnifications  The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant
payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  
The
Company's market risk profile has not changed significantly during the first nine months of 2009.  Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk
Management  The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in
conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the
hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments
for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Interest Rate Risk  While the Company is exposed to
interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest
rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, the fair value of those marketable securities, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  The Company's investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the Company. A
portion of the Company's cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company's investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. The Company's internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager
performance.  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment
portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better with the
objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company classifies its marketable securities
as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument's underlying contractual maturity date. All short-term marketable securities have maturities less than 12 months, while all long-term marketable securities have maturities ranging from
one to five years. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during the
three- and nine-month periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 related to such sales.  
38 
Foreign Currency Risk  In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the
Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign
currency exchange rates.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect
against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to
hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality,
accounting considerations, and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.  
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of June27, 2009 to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms and (ii)accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2009, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  
As of June27, 2009, the
end of the quarterly period covered by this report, the Company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below, as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2009 that did not individually or in the aggregate
have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.  Bader v. Anderson, et al.  Plaintiff filed this purported shareholder derivative action against the Company and each of its then current executive officers and members of its Board
of Directors on May19, 2005 in Santa Clara County Superior Court asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, material misstatements and omissions and violations of California Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair
competition). The complaint alleged that the Company's March14, 2005, proxy statement was false and misleading for failure to disclose certain information relating to the Apple Computer, Inc. Performance Bonus Plan, which was approved by
shareholders at the annual meeting held on April21, 2005. Plaintiff, who ostensibly brought suit on the Company's behalf, made no demand on the Board of Directors and alleged that such demand was excused. The complaint sought injunctive
and other relief for purported injury to the Company. On July27, 2005, plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging that, in addition to the purported derivative claims, adoption of the bonus plan and distribution of the proxy statement
describing that plan also inflicted injury on her directly as an individual shareholder. On January10, 2006, the Court sustained defendants' demurrer to the amended complaint, with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint on February7, 2006, and the Company filed a demurrer. After a hearing on June13, 2006, the Court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the non-director officers and with leave to amend as to the directors. On
July24, 2006, plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, which purported to bring claims derivatively as well as directly on behalf of a class of common stockholders who have been or will be harmed by virtue of the allegedly misleading proxy
statement. In addition to reasserting prior causes of action, the third amended complaint included a claim that the Company violated the terms of the plan, and a claim for waste related to restricted stock unit grants to certain officers in 2003 and
2004 and an option grant to the Company's CEO in January 2000. The Company filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint. On January30, 2007, the Court sustained the Company's demurrer with leave to amend. On May8, 2007,
plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint. The Company filed a demurrer to the fourth amended complaint, which the Court sustained, without leave to amend, on October12, 2007. On October25, 2007, the Court entered a final judgment in
favor of defendant and ordered the case dismissed with prejudice. On November26, 2007, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. Plaintiff's appeal is pending.  Birdsong v. Apple Computer, Inc.  This action alleges that the Company's iPod music players, and
the ear bud headphones sold with them, are inherently defective in design and are sold without adequate warnings concerning the risk of noise-induced hearing loss by iPod users. The Birdsong action was initially filed on January30, 2006 in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana asserting Louisiana causes of action on behalf of a purported Louisiana class of iPod purchasers. A similar action (Patterson v. Apple Computer, Inc.) was filed on
January31, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting California causes of action on behalf of a purported class of all iPod purchasers within the four-year period before January31, 2006.
The Birdsong action was transferred to the Northern District of California, and the Patterson action was dismissed. An amended complaint was subsequently filed in Birdsong, dropping the Louisiana law-based claims and adding California law-based
claims equivalent to those in Patterson. After the Company filed a motion to dismiss on November3, 2006, plaintiffs agreed not to oppose the motion and filed a second amended complaint on January16, 2007. That complaint alleges
California law-based claims for breaches of implied and express warranties, violations of California Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition), California Business Professions Code 17500 (false
advertising), the Consumer Legal Remedies Act and negligent misrepresentation on behalf of a putative nationwide class and a 
40 
Louisiana law-based claim for redhibition for a Louisiana sub-class. On March1, 2007, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the California law-based
claims, which was heard on June4, 2007. On December14, 2007, the Court issued an order granting the Company's motion, with leave to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on January11, 2008. On
February15, 2008, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On June16, 2008, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice. On July11, 2008, plaintiffs
filed a notice of appeal. Plaintiffs' appeal is pending.  A similar complaint, Royer-Brennan v. Apple Computer, Inc. and Apple
Canada, Inc., was filed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on February1, 2006, seeking authorization to institute a class action on behalf of iPod purchasers in Quebec. Plaintiffs filed a motion to amend their complaint to add a minor plaintiff
and claims regarding alleged risks of hearing loss to young people. The hearing on the motion to amend took place on April24, 2009. The Court has not issued a ruling.  Boston Retirement Board v. Apple Computer, Inc.  On November3, 2006, the Boston Retirement
Board, a purported shareholder, filed a petition for writ of mandate in Santa Clara County Superior Court to compel the inspection of records relating to the Company's option practices and the Special Committee's investigation (Boston
Retirement Board v. Apple Computer Inc.). Following a September24, 2007 trial, the Court granted the petition but narrowed the scope of the records to be produced.On April14, 2008, the Boston Retirement Board filed a derivative
action against certain current and former officers and directors in Santa Clara County Superior Court. The Boston Retirement Board filed a motion for fees on November6, 2008. By stipulation filed December10, 2008, the Boston Retirement
Board agreed to dismiss the derivative action with prejudice upon a final order regarding its fees motion. On January15, 2009, the Court denied the Boston Retirement Board's motion for fees. On April8, 2009, the Court entered the
parties' Stipulation and Proposed Order of Dismissal with Prejudice. The derivative action is now concluded.  Branning et al. v. Apple Computer,
Inc.  Plaintiffs originally filed this purported class action in San Francisco County Superior Court on February17, 2005. The
initial complaint alleged violations of California Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition) and violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act regarding a variety of purportedly unfair and unlawful conduct including, but
not limited to, allegedly selling used computers as new and failing to honor warranties. Plaintiffs also brought causes of action for misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract and violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
Plaintiffs requested unspecified damages and other relief. On May2, 2005, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding two new named plaintiffs and three new causes of action including a claim for treble damages under the Cartwright Act
(California Business Professions Code 16700 et seq.) and a claim for false advertising. On May9, 2005, the Court granted the Company's motion to transfer the case to Santa Clara County Superior Court. The Company filed a
demurrer to the amended complaint, which the Court sustained in its entirety on November10, 2005. The Court granted plaintiffs leave to amend and they filed an amended complaint on December29, 2005. Plaintiffs' amended complaint
added three plaintiffs and alleged many of the same factual claims as the previous complaints, such as alleged selling of used equipment as new, alleged failure to honor warranties and service contracts for the consumer plaintiffs, and alleged fraud
related to the opening of the Apple retail stores. Plaintiffs continued to assert causes of action for unfair competition (17200), violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, violations
of the Cartwright Act, and alleged new causes of action for fraud, conversion, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Company filed a demurrer to the amended complaint on January31, 2006, which the Court
sustained on March3, 2006 on sixteen of seventeen causes of action. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding one new plaintiff. The Company filed a demurrer, which was granted in part on September9, 2006. Plaintiffs filed a further

Plaintiffs filed a Sixth Amended Complaint on July14, 2008 and a Seventh Amended Complaint on August22, 2008, adding three new reseller plaintiffs. On August22, 2008, plaintiffs also filed a motion to certify the consumer class. On
September22, 2008, the Company filed its answer to the consumer-related claims denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses, and also filed a demurrer to the new reseller claims, which the Court heard on January30,
2009. The Court sustained the demurrer as to all plaintiffs 
41 
except one, with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed an Eighth Amended Complaint further amending the reseller claims on February24, 2009, and on
March26, 2009, the Company filed a demurrer which was overruled, and a motion to strike which was denied. The Company filed motions for summary adjudication for certain claims of two named plaintiffs, which the Court granted on
November10, 2008. Plaintiffs petitioned the Court of Appeal for a writ of certiorari from the summary adjudication ruling and a motion to stay the class certification hearing, which the Court of Appeal denied on December17, 2008. On
December19, 2008, the Court held a hearing on plaintiffs' class certification motion. The Court requested further briefing and an additional hearing, which did not take place because on February23, 2009, Hon. Jamie A. Jacobs-May
disqualified herself from the case. The Company filed a petition for a writ of mandate from this order, which the Court of Appeal denied on May19, 2009. The case has been reassigned to Hon. Joseph H. Huber. The class certification hearing on

January23, 2008, defendants filed an opposition to plaintiff's motion. Plaintiff's motion was heard on March21, 2008. On May14, 2008, the Court issued an order denying plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend. The court
entered judgment dismissing the case on June12, 2008. On June17, 2008, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. Plaintiffs' appeal is pending.  Vogel v. Apple Inc., et al. (2008 Action)  Plaintiff filed this purported class action on June27, 2008, in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors. The allegations, which arise out of the Company's past stock option practices,
are similar to those in the 2006 Vogel v. Jobs et al. action that was dismissed on June12, 2008, as described above. The complaint purports to be brought on behalf of several classes of holders of the Company's stock
and asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks rescission of amendments to various stock option and other incentive compensation plans, an accounting and damages in an unspecified amount. On July22,
2008, the Court stayed this case pending the appeal in the 2006 Action.  
Because of the following factors, as
well as other factors affecting the Company's financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to
anticipate results or trends in future periods.  Economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.  The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions
poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending inresponse to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on demand for the Company's
products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company's expectations since the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to offset the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a
trend that has been very pronounced recently. Other factors that could influence demand include continuing increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access
to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company's products and services and on the
Company's financial condition and operating results.  The current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and
financialmarkets and the possibility additional financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in a tightening in the creditmarkets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, andextreme
volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. Therecould be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis onthe Company's business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain
credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting inproduct delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to financepurchases of the Company's products and/or customer, including
channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the Company's treasury operations. Other income andexpense also could vary materially from expectations
depending on gains or lossesrealized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equitysecurities and other investments; interest rates;cash balances; and changes in
fair value of derivative instruments.The current volatility in the financial markets and overall economicuncertainty increase the risk the actual amounts realized in thefuture on the Company's financial instruments could
differ significantlyfrom the fair values currently assigned to them.  
46 
Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of
the Company's stock price.  The matters relating to the Company's past stock option practices and its restatement of consolidated financial
statements may result in additional litigation.  The Company's investigation into its past stock option practices and its
restatement of prior financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending September30, 2006 gave rise to litigation and government investigations. As described in Part II, Item1, Legal
Proceedings, several derivative and class action complaints regarding stock options were filed against the Company and current and former officers and directors. These actions have been dismissed following a comprehensive settlement. Two
former officers of the Company were also named as defendants in an SEC enforcement action, which has been settled.  No assurance can be
given that additional actions will not be filed against the Company and current and former officers and directors as a result of past stock option practices. If such actions are filed and result in adverse findings, the remedies could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Global markets for personal computers, digital music devices,
mobile communication devices, and related peripherals and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and operating results
could be materially adversely affected.  The Company competes in global markets that are highly competitive and characterized by
aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid
adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.  The Company's
ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly
the entire solution for its personal computers, consumer electronics, and mobile communication devices, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant
investments in research and development and as such, the Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. By contrast, many of
the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe
on the Company's intellectual property, the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  In the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines,
lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. Consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal
computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. The Company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government, and creative markets. An increasing number of
Internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company's existing products.  The Company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers
using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. The Company's financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company's ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain functional and design
advantages. Use of unauthorized copies of the Mac OS on other companies' hardware products may result in decreased demand for the Company's hardware products, and could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and
operating results.  
47 
The Company is currently focused on certain mobile communication devices, such as iPhone, consumer
electronic devices, including the iPod family of digital music players, and third-party digital content and applications distribution. The Company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution,
and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company has only recently
entered the mobile communications market, and many of its competitors in the mobile communications market have significantly greater experience, product breadth, and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential
competitors have substantial resources and experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors
attempt to imitate the Company's approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.  The Company currently receives subsidies from its exclusive and non-exclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued
at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company's agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.  There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.  To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.  Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies,
enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful product development, market
acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in
line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the
Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and operating results.  The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk.  The Company records a write-down for product and component
inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets
exceeds its fair market value. Although the Company believes its inventory, asset, and related provisions are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal
computer, consumer electronics, and mobile communication industries, the Company will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges. Such charges have had, and could have, a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition
and operating results.  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and
shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand. Such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component
and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days. Because the Company's markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or
insufficient inventories of components or products. The Company's financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory
levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  
48 
Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to
microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities.  Because the Company currently
obtains certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and ASICs, from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these
and other key components that are available from multiple sources including, but not limited to NAND flash memory, DRAM and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company has
entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these
agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. The follow-on effects from the credit crisis onthe Company's key suppliers, referred to in Economic conditions
could materially adversely affect the Company above, which is incorporated herein by reference, also could affect the Company's ability to obtain key components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant
risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results. The Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to
levels achieved during 2008 and 2007, due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key
components, and higher logistical costs. For additional information refer to Part I, Item2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the subheading Gross Margin,
which is incorporated herein by reference.  The Company and other participants in the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile
communication industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, consumer
electronics or mobile communication industries. The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional
suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those
suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or
constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected.  The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of
whom are located outside of the U.S.  Most of the Company's components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few
third-party manufacturers. Many of these manufacturers are located outside of the U.S., and are concentrated in several general locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements
may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company's
flexibility to respond to changing conditions. In addition, the Company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the Company's supplier code of conduct. Although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty
expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or
otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, financial condition and operating results.  
49 
Final assembly of the Company's products is currently performed in the Company's manufacturing
facility in Ireland, and by external vendors in Texas, Korea, China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the U.S., China, Japan, Korea,
Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Sole-sourced third-party vendors in China perform final assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable products, including MacBook Pro, MacBook, MacBook Air, iPods, iPhones, and
most of the Company's iMacs. If manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public
health, or political issues, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The Company relies on
third-party digital content and applications, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  The
Company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content and applications through the Company's iTunes Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to audio and video content. The Company's licensing
arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products
and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the total
cost of, such content. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the Company's financial condition and operating results
may be materially adversely affected.  Many third-party content providers require that the Company provide certain digital rights
management (DRM) and other security solutions. If these requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such
solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the Company to license its DRM, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and
also could affect arrangements with the Company's content providers.  The Company relies on access to third-party patents and intellectual
property, and the Company's future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights.  Many of the Company's products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the Company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business
methods. Although the Company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or
at all.  Because of technological changes in the global personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries,
current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third
parties. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. Regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense. At present, the Company is vigorously defending more than 37
patent infringement cases, 19 of which were filed during fiscal 2009, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no
assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If the Company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages. If there is a temporary or
permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the Company's financial condition and operating
results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology. While in management's opinion the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal
proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results, the results of such legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  
50 
With the June 2007 introduction of iPhone, the Company has begun to compete with mobile communication
device companies that hold significant patent portfolios.Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents orthe merits of anypotential patent claims by competitors, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter
into expensive agreements or settlements and/ormodify its products. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company's future performance depends on support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed
and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.  The Company believes
decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its Macs, iPods, and iPhones, are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party
developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the Company's products on a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition and operating results.  With respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of
third-party software applications and services depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products compared to Windows-based
products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such
applications and services. If the Company's minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Company's prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the
Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. The Company's development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the
decisions of third-party developers, such as Microsoft, Adobe, and Google, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the Company's products. Mac OS X Leopard, which became available in October 2007,
includes a new feature that enables Intel-based Mac systems to run Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems. This feature may deter developers from creating software applications for Mac OS X if such applications are already
available for the Windows platform.  With respect to iPhone and iPod touch, the Company relies on the continued availability and
development of compelling and innovative software applications. Unlike third-party software applications for Mac products, the software applications for the iPhone and iPod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel, the
iTunes Store. The absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Company's customers, thereby causing developers to curtail
significantly, or stop, development for the Company's platforms. In addition, iPhone and iPod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change, third-party
applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. Further, if the Company develops its own software applications and services, such development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to
develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive applications for the iPhone and iPod touch platforms. As with applications for the Company's Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on
developers' perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Company's products rather than its competitors' products, including devices that use competing platforms. If developers focus their efforts
on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices may suffer.  The Company's products and
services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin.  The Company sells
highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can
unexpectedly interfere with the software's intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will 
51 
be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, harm to reputation, and
significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The
Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.  The Company's profit margins
vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company's software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company's other products. Gross margins on the
Company's hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company's direct sales
generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company's gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely
impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, strengthening U.S. dollar, or price competition. The Company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal
quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year, respectively. Furthermore, the Company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month
of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key
logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  In certain countries, including the U.S., the Company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iPhone.  In each of the U.S., U.K., Germany, Spain, Ireland, and certain other countries, the Company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iPhone on an exclusive basis. If these exclusive carriers cannot
successfully compete with other carriers in their markets on any basis, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services, performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other
terms of conditions of end-user contracts, or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iPhone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected. 
The Company is subject to risks associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications devices.  Laws and regulations related to mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change.
Such changes, whichcould include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carrier's network, or mandating the use of the device on more than one
carrier's network, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Mobile
communication devices, such as iPhone, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.These certification processes are extensive and
time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
The Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.  Information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company's operations by causing delays or
cancellation of customer, including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the Company's online offerings and services, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial results, resulting
in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information, or damage to the Company's reputation. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures,
there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  
52 
The Company's stock price continues to be volatile.  The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, variations between its actual and anticipated financial
results, announcements by the Company and its competitors, and uncertainty about current global economic conditions. The stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many
technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance. Furthermore, the Company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. If the Company fails to meet
these expectations its stock price may significantly decline.  Political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other
circumstances could materially adversely affect the Company.  War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and
other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors
and customers, including channel partners. The Company's business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other
events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company's products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from
its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions,
additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company's manufacturing vendors and
component suppliers. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing
vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, the Company's financial condition and
operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.  The Company's success depends largely on the
continued service and availability of key personnel.  Much of the Company's future success depends on the continued availability
and service of key personnel, including its CEO, its executive team and highly skilled employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is
intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where most of the Company's key personnel are located. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to attract and retain key personnel. The Company's CEO recently returned from a
medical leave of absence.  In addition, the Company has relied on equity awards in the form of stock options and restricted stock units as
one means for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent. Significant adverse volatility in the Company's stock price could result in a stock option's exercise price exceeding the underlying stock's market value or a significant
deterioration in the value of restricted stock units granted, thus lessening the effectiveness of stock-based awards for retaining employees.  Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company.  The Company is subject to various
legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its
merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into material
settlements. Should the Company fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief
against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  
53 
The Company's business is subject to the risks of international operations.  The Company derives a large and growing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. As a result, its financial condition and
operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of
the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. Margins on sales of the Company's products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  The
Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia, as well as non-U.S. dollar denominated operating expenses
incurred throughout the world. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the Company to
raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar's
strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the Company's
foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company's cost of product components
denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  The Company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign
exchange forward and option positions, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable
movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.  The Company's retail business has required and will continue to
require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  Through June27,
2009, the Company had opened 258 retail stores. The Company's retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company also has entered into
substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve
as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company's more typical retail stores. Due to the high fixed cost
structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and
severance costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Many factors
unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company's control, pose risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results. These risks and uncertainties
include, among other things, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company's inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party
products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail
inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.

Investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company's ongoing business and present
risks not originally contemplated.  The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions.
Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate return of capital,
and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company's due diligence. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company's future operating performance depends on the performance of
distributors, carriers, and other resellers.  The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional
retailers, value-added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end-users,
certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online and retail stores. iPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers' distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers.  Many resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. Some resellers have perceived
the expansion of the Company's direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company's products. Such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and
sale of the Company's products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers
weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. The Company has
invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a
substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.  Changes in the Company's tax rates, the adoption of new U.S.
tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect its future results.  The Company is subject to income
taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company's future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred
tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the current administration and Congress have recently announced proposals for new U.S. tax legislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect the
Company's tax rate. Any of these changes could have a material adverse affect on the Company's profitability. The Company is also subject to the continual examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have
a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in
the market values of its investment portfolio.  Although the Company has not recognized any material losses on its cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results. Given the global nature of its business, the Company has investments
both domestically and internationally. Additionally, the Company's overall investment portfolio has concentrations in the financial sector, which has been negatively impacted by the recent market liquidity conditions. Credit ratings and pricing
of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could
decline and result in a material impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  
55 
The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply
agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  A substantial majority of the Company's
outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by contract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies
or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to
credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition and operating results.  The Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and
environmental protection.  The Company's products and services, and the production and distribution of those goods and services,
are subject to a variety of laws and regulations. These may require the Company to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the
Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does
not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition
and operating results.  The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance.  For certain risks, the Company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or availability.Because the Company retains some portion of
its insurable risks, and in some cases self-insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.
