Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) design, manufacture, and market
personal computers, mobile communication devices, and portable digital music and video players and sell a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company sells
its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh (Mac),
iPhone, iPad and iPod compatible products including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and
mid-sized business, education, enterprise, government and creative customers.  Basis of Presentation and Preparation 
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.  These condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September26, 2009, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, as
amended (the 2009 Form 10-K). Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 
Retrospective Adoption of New Accounting Principles 
In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the accounting standards related to revenue
recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements (new accounting principles). The new accounting principles permit prospective or retrospective adoption, and the Company elected
retrospective adoption during the first quarter of 2010.  Under the historical accounting principles, the Company was required
to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription accounting because the Company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription
accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iPhone and Apple TV were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each product's estimated economic life. This resulted in the deferral of significant
amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple TV.  The new accounting principles generally require the
Company to account for the sale of both iPhone and Apple TV as two deliverables. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is
the right included with the purchase of iPhone and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product's essential software. The new accounting principles result in the
recognition of substantially all of the revenue and product costs from the sales of iPhone and Apple TV at the time of sale. Additionally, the Company is required to estimate a standalone selling price for the unspecified software upgrade rights
included with the sale of iPhone and Apple TV and recognizes that amount ratably over the 24-month estimated life of the related hardware device. 
The Company had the option of adopting the new accounting principles on a prospective or retrospective basis. Prospective adoption would
have required the Company to apply the new accounting principles to sales beginning in  
5 
fiscal year 2010 without reflecting the impact of the new accounting principles on iPhone and Apple TV sales made prior to September 2009. Accordingly, the Company's financial results for
the two years following adoption would have included the impact of amortizing the significant amounts of deferred revenue and cost of sales related to historical iPhone and Apple TV sales. The Company believes prospective adoption would have
resulted in financial information that was not comparable between financial periods because of the significant amount of past iPhone sales; therefore, the Company elected retrospective adoption. Retrospective adoption required the Company to revise
its previously issued financial statements as if the new accounting principles had always been applied. The Company believes retrospective adoption provides the most comparable and useful financial information for financial statement users, is more
consistent with the information the Company's management uses to evaluate its business, and better reflects the underlying economic performance of the Company. 
Refer to the Explanatory Note and Note 2, Retrospective Adoption of New Accounting Principles in the 2009 Form
10-K for additional information on the impact of adoption.  Earnings Per Common Share 
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to
include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding options, shares to be purchased under the employee
stock purchase plan, and unvested restricted stock units (RSUs). The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury
stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three- and six-month periods ended
March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):  
Potentially dilutive securities representing
approximately 1.3million and 19.2million shares of common stock for the three months ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009, respectively, and 0.8million and 18.0million shares of common stock for the six months
ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. 
Revenue Recognition  Net
sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.  
6 
Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at
the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains
a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., Mac computers, iPhones, iPods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware that is essential to the
functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting
guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)standalone sales of software products, (ii)sales of software upgrades and (iii)sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These
contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Company's standard limited warranty. 
The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company generally establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained
from other companies based on the gross amount billed.  The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments
related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period
the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers
that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. 
Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables 
For multi-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the tangible product's
functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product's essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the new accounting
principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i)vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii)third-party evidence of selling
price (TPE), and (iii)best estimate of the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs
reflect the Company's best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. 
For both iPhone and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and
features free of charge to customers. The Company has identified two deliverables generally contained in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone and Apple TV. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the
hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of iPhone and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the
product's essential software. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the two deliverables the allocation of revenue has been
based on the Company's ESPs. Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to the
unspecified software upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of the related hardware. All product cost of sales, including estimated warranty costs, are generally recognized at the time of
sale. Costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred.  For all periods presented, the Company's
ESP for the software upgrade rights included with each iPhone and Apple TV sold is $25 and $10, respectively. The Company's process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending
upon the unique facts and circumstances related to  
7 
each deliverable. The Company believes its customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iPhone and Apple TV. This view is primarily
based on the fact that upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered in the future. Therefore, the Company has concluded
that if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis, such as those included with iPhone and Apple TV, the selling price would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for iPhone and Apple TV upgrade
rights include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, the Company's historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as
compared to the total selling price of the product. In addition, when developing ESPs for products other than iPhone and Apple TV, the Company may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist,
and product-specific business objectives.  The Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of
software or software-related products, including the sale of upgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software-related transactions. For such transactions, revenue on
arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, and fair value is generally determined by VSOE. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered
element included in such multiple-element arrangements, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the
fair value of a delivered element has not been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the
residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. 
Except as described for iPhone and Apple TV, the Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its
customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. A limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future
upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 
Fair Value Measurements 
During 2009, the Company adopted the FASB's new accounting standard on fair value measurements and disclosures for all financial
assets and liabilities. The new accounting principles defined fair value, provided a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded the disclosures required for fair value measurements. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company adopted the new
fair value accounting principles for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, which did not have a material effect on
the Company's financial condition or operating results.  Business Combinations 
In December 2007, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for business combinations, which established principles and requirements for
how an acquirer is to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. This new accounting standard also
established principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements. In April 2009, the FASB amended this
new accounting standard to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. The Company
adopted the new business combination accounting standard in the first quarter of 2010 and applied these principles to any business combinations completed in or after the first quarter of 2010. The adoption of the new business combination accounting
standard did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results.

Note 2  Financial Instruments 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's cash and available-for-sale securities held in its marketable
securities investment portfolio, recorded as cash, cash equivalents or short-term or long-term marketable securities as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009 (in millions): 
9 
The following tables summarize the Company's available-for-sale securities'
adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment category as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009 (in millions): 
The Company had net unrealized gains on its investment
portfolio of $57 million both as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009. The net unrealized gains as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009 are related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell
certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no significant net gains or losses during the three- and
six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 related to such sales.  
10 
The following tables show the gross unrealized losses and fair value for investments in an
unrealized loss position as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions): 
The unrealized losses on the Company's marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market
interest rates. The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its policy generally limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost
basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company's intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment's amortized cost
basis. During the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009, the Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges on outstanding securities. As of March27, 2010, the Company does not consider
any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing
assets and liabilities. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company's subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency
revenue. The Company's subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currencies. The
Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  
11 
The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the
instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until
the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and
the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense. 
The Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $29 million and $1 million, net of taxes, recorded
in other comprehensive income as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009, respectively. Other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period
as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Hedged transactions as of
March27, 2010 are expected to occur within six months.  Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be
de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated
with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as
hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and
March28, 2009, respectively.  The Company had an unrealized net gain on net investment hedges of $2 million and
unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of $2 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009,
respectively. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense. 
The Company recognized in earnings a net gain on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments of
$24 million and a net loss of $10 million during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010, respectively, and a net gain on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments of $15 million and $173
million during the three- and six-month periods ended March28, 2009, respectively.  The following table shows the
notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Company's derivative instruments outstanding as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009 (in millions): 
The notional principal
amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009, and do not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market loss. The credit
risk amounts represent the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each
respective date. The Company's gross exposure on these  
12 
transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency
exchange rates. Although the table above reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the
foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the
remaining life of the instruments.  The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by
permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received when the net fair value of certain
financial instruments exceeds contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values.As of March27, 2010, the Company has received cash collateral related to
the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $71 million and recorded the offsetting balance as accrued expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not record any significant amounts of cash
collateral related to the derivative instruments under its master netting arrangements as of September26, 2009. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that would require it to post
additional collateral as of March27, 2010 or September26, 2009.  The estimates of fair value are based on
applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009. Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements of this Form 10-Q, for additional information on the
fair value measurements for all financial assets and liabilities, including derivative assets and derivative liabilities, that are measured at fair value in the condensed consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. The following tables
show the Company's derivative instruments measured at gross fair value as reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009 (in millions): 
13 
The following tables show the pre-tax effect of the Company's derivative instruments
designated as cash flow and net investment hedges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 (in millions): 
14 
Note 3  Fair Value Measurements 
The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous
market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. 
The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and
bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 
Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2  Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
Level 3  Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  The Company's valuation techniques used to measure the fair
value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments,
all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

Note 5  Income Taxes 
As of March27, 2010, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $946 million, of which $348 million, if recognized,
would affect the Company's effective tax rate. As of September26, 2009, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate. The
Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had $272 million and $291 million of gross interest and penalties accrued as of
March27, 2010 and September26, 2009, respectively, which are also classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by
between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12months.  Note 6  Shareholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation
Preferred Stock 
The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the
Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 
19 
Comprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains, and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those
subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash
flow hedges.  The following table summarizes the components of total comprehensive income, net of taxes, during the three- and
six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 (in millions):

Employee Benefit Plans 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
During the second quarter of 2010, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Ronald B. Johnson, Peter Oppenheimer, Mark Papermaster, Philip W.
Schiller and Bertrand Serlet had trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates
(or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's employee stock purchase
plan and upon vesting of RSUs.  
20 
2003 Employee Stock Plan 
The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to
employees, including executive officers. At the Company's 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, the 2003 Plan was amended to (1)increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards
granted under the 2003 Plan by an additional 36,000,000 shares and (2)extend the Company's authority to grant awards under the 2003 Plan intended to qualify as performance-based awards within the meaning of Section162(m)
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code through the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders.  1997 Director Stock Plan 
In August1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Plan (the Director Plan) for non-employee
directors of the Company, which was approved by shareholders in 1998. At the Company's 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, the Director Plan was amended to (1)permit the Company to grant awards of restricted stock units under the
Director Plan, (2)effective for grants awarded on or after February25, 2010, replace the automatic initial and annual grants of stock options under the Director Plan with automatic initial and annual grants of restricted stock units
under the plan, (3)modify the Director Plan's existing share-counting provision so that RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Director Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted, and
(4)extend the term of the Director Plan to November9, 2019.  Restricted Stock Units 
A summary of the Company's RSU activity and related information for the six months ended March27, 2010, is as follows (in
thousands, except per share amounts):  
The fair value as of the vesting date of RSUs that vested was $345 million and $637 million for
the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010, respectively, and $2 million and $88 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March28, 2009, respectively. 
21 
Stock Option Activity 
A summary of the Company's stock option and RSU activity and related information for the six months ended March27, 2010, is as
follows (in thousands, except per share amounts and contractual term in years):  
Aggregate intrinsic
value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate
intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative intrinsic value. The total intrinsic value of options at the time of exercise was $377 million and $1.1 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended
March27, 2010, respectively, and $94 million and $149 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March28, 2009, respectively. 
RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company's stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times
the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added back to the shares available for grant under the Company's stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled. Outstanding RSU balances are not
included in the outstanding options balances in the stock option activity table.  Stock-Based Compensation 
Stock-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date
of grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each option's fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes Merton (BSM) option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model
incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life and interest rates.The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the
estimated expected life of the Company's stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical
experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
22 
The weighted-average assumptions used for stock options granted do not apply to employee
stock options assumed in conjunction with business acquisitions during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010. The weighted-average fair value of stock options assumed during the three- and six-month periods ended March27,
2010 was $198.22. The weighted-average assumptions used for the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of stock options granted and of
employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) during those periods are as follows:  
The following
table provides a summary of the stock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 (in millions): 
The income tax benefit related to stock-based
compensation expense was $79 million and $161 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010, respectively, and was $66 million and $132 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March28, 2009. As of
March27, 2010, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.9 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.77 years. 
Note 7  Commitments and Contingencies 
Lease Commitments  The
Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are
generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year
renewal options. As of September26, 2009, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $1.9 billion, of which $1.5 billion related to leases for retail space. As of March27, 2010, total
future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases related to leases for retail space increased $200 million to $1.7 billion.  
23 
Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications 
The following table reconciles changes in the Company's accrued warranties and related costs for the three- and six-month periods
ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 (in millions):  
The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against
legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the
event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party
and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company
did not record a liability for indemnification costs as of either March27, 2010 or September26, 2009.  The Company
has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of
their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make
under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its
exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the Company's financial condition or operating results. 
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 
Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components
including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single
or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not
limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain
favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. 
The Company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer
electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a
component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company's supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or
existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key 
24 
manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The
Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.
Significant portions of the Company's Mac computers, iPhones, iPads, iPods, logic boards and other assembled products
are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Company's outsourcing partners, often in single
locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Company's key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the
Company's portable Mac computers, iPhones, iPads, iPods and most of the Company's desktop products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be
adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company's purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. 
Contingencies  The
Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated, which are discussed in Part II, Item1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading Legal
Proceedings. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or
operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same
reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  Production
and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe
and Asia and certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such
existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition or operating results.  Note 8
Segment Information and Geographic Data  The Company reports segment information based on the management
approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. 
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating and reporting
segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific segments exclude activities related to the Retail
segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asia, but does not include Japan. The Retail
segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers. The accounting policies of
the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2009 Form 10-K. 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic
segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Company's retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third
25 
parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are
incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs
and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The
Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous
corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail
segment were $41 million and $148 million during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010, respectively, and $30 million and $101 million during the three- and six-month periods ended March28, 2009. 
The Company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and
serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company's more typical retail stores. The Company allocates
certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a
high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 12 high-profile stores as of March27, 2010. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of
high-profile stores were $19 million and $36 million during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010, respectively, and $16 million and $32 million during the three- and six-month periods ended March28, 2009, respectively.
Summary information by operating segment for the three- and six-month periods months ended March27, 2010 and
March28, 2009 is as follows (in millions):

Note 9  Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions 
The Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr.Jobs
in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Company recognized a total of $127,000 and $143,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010,
respectively. The Company did not recognize any expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during the three months ended March28, 2009 and recognized a total of $4,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during the six
months ended March28, 2009. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the accounting standards related to
revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements (new accounting principles). The Company adopted the new accounting principles on a retrospective basis during the first
quarter of 2010.  Under the historical accounting principles, the Company was required to account for sales of both iPhone and
Apple TV using subscription accounting because the Company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated
product cost of sales for iPhone and Apple TV were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each product's estimated economic life. This resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of
sales related to iPhone and Apple TV.  The new accounting principles generally require the Company to account for the sale of
both iPhone and Apple TV as two deliverables. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase
of iPhone and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product's essential software. The new accounting principles result in the recognition of substantially all of
the revenue and product costs from the sales of iPhone and Apple TV at the time of sale. Additionally, the Company is required to estimate a standalone selling price for the unspecified software upgrade rights included with the sale of iPhone and
Apple TV and recognizes that amount ratably over the 24-month estimated life of the related hardware device.  Note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the subheadings Basis of Presentation and Preparation and Revenue Recognition of this Form 10-Q provides additional information on the Company's
change in accounting resulting from the adoption of the new accounting principles and the Company's revenue recognition accounting policy.

Executive Overview 
The Company designs, manufactures, and markets a range of personal computing products, mobile communication and
consumer electronics devices, and portable digital music and video players and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company's products and services include the
Mac line of desktop and portable computers,
iPhone, iPad, the
iPod line of portable digital music and video players, Apple
TV,
Xserve, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac
OS X operating system, third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes
Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide
through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPhone, iPad and iPod compatible products,
including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB),
education, enterprise, government, and creative markets. A further description of the Company's products may be found below under the heading Products and Part II, Item1A, Risk Factors, as well as in Part I,
Item1, Business, of the Company's 2009 Form 10-K.  The Company is focused on providing innovative
products and solutions to consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government and creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles and work environments. The Company's overall business strategy is to control the design and
development of the hardware and software for all of its products, including the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics devices. The Company's business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its
own operating system, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in
research and development is critical to the development and enhancement of innovative products and technologies.  In
conjunction with its strategy, the Company continues to build and host a robust platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store. The Company's App Store and iBookstore
allow users to browse, search for, and purchase third-party applications and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or by wirelessly downloading directly to an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. The Company also desires to support a community
for the development of third-party products that complement the Company's offerings through its developer programs. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle and productivity solutions.
The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of personal
computers; mobile communications and consumer electronics devices with its iPhone, iPad and iPod product families; and through distribution of third-party digital content and applications with its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely
recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the market for distribution of digital content and applications, these markets are highly competitive and
subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The
Company's research and development spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of personal computers; the Mac OS X operating system; application software for the Mac; iPhone, iPad and iPod line of portable digital music and
video players and related software; development of new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes increased investment in marketing and
advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.  The Company utilizes a variety of direct and
indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the
unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on Mac computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support
experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution
capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. The Company had 286 stores open as of March27, 2010.  
29 
The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales,
including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected
third-party reseller locations, and the Apple Premium Reseller Program, through which independently run businesses focus on the Apple platform and provide a high level of customer service and product expertise. The Company believes providing direct
contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac computers and other products over those of its competitors.The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world
and through its direct sales force.  The Company distributes iPhones in over 80 countries, through its direct channels, its
cellular network carriers' distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. The Company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for
iPhones. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the U.S., Germany, Spain and certain other countries. 
The Company's iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. iPods can be purchased in
certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above. 
Product Updates  In
January 2010, the Company introduced iPad, a multi-purpose mobile device for browsing the web, reading and sending email, viewing photos, watching videos, listening to music, playing games, reading e-books and more. iPad is based on the
Company's Multi-Touch technology, has a 9.7-inch LED-backlit display, is 0.5 inches thick and weighs 1.5 pounds. iPad will be available in two models, one with Wi-Fi connectivity and the other with both Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity. The iPad
with Wi-Fi began shipping in the U.S. in early April 2010 and the 3G version is expected to begin shipping in the U.S. on April 30, 2010. Both versions of iPad are expected to be available in nine additional countries at the end of May 2010.
In January 2010, the Company also introduced a new version of
iWork for iPad, a productivity suite including versions of
Pages,
Keynote and
Numbers designed specifically for Multi-Touch. Each of these applications is available for purchase separately
through the App Store.  In April 2010, the Company previewed its new iPhone OS 4 software, which is expected to be available
for iPhone and iPod touch users in the summer of 2010 and for iPad users in the fall of 2010. iPhone OS 4 software includes new features, such as support for multi-tasking for third-party applications, folders to organize and access applications, a
unified Mail inbox, the iAd mobile advertising platform, and the iBooks reader and online bookstore. Certain features of iPhone OS 4 software will not function on some earlier iPhone and iPod touch models. 
In April 2010, the Company began shipping new versions of
itsMacBook Pro family of portable computers, updated with faster processors, next-generation NVIDIA
graphics and longer battery life.  A detailed discussion of the Company's other products may be found in Part I,
Item1, Business, of the Company's 2009 Form 10-K.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2009 Form 10-K describes the
significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. 
Management believes the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of
marketable securities, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers
30 
these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and
estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. 
Revenue Recognition  Net
sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the
product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., Mac computers, iPhones, iPods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware
that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific
software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)standalone sales of software products, (ii)sales of software upgrades and (iii)sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the
functionality of the hardware.  For multi-element arrangements that include tangible products containing software essential to
the tangible product's functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible product's essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances,
the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i)vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii)third-party
evidence of selling price (TPE) and (iii)best estimate of the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that
deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company's best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. 
For iPhone, the Company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to
customers. The Company has identified two deliverables generally contained in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time
of sale, and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of iPhone to receive on a when-and-if-available basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product's essential software. The Company has
allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the two deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the Company's ESPs. Amounts allocated
to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade right are deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of the related hardware. All product cost of sales, including estimated warranty costs, are generally recognized at the time of sale. Costs for engineering and sales and marketing
are expensed as incurred. If the estimated life of the hardware product should change, the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade right will also change. 
For all periods presented, the Company's ESP for the software upgrade right included with each iPhone sold is $25. The
Company's process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE involves management's judgment. The Company's process considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to
each deliverable. The Company believes its customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iPhone. This view is primarily based on the fact that upgrade rights do not obligate the Company
to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered in the future. Therefore, the Company has concluded if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis, such as
those included with iPhone, the selling price would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for iPhone upgrade rights include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, the Company's historical
pricing practices, the nature of the  
31 
upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. If the facts and circumstances
underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company's ESP for software upgrades related to future iPhone sales could change in future periods.
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive
programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund
amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company's policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can
be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company
also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur
incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will
actually redeem the incentive. Management's estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the
Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. 
Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities 
The Company's investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes
in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of investments impact the Company's net
income only when such investments are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security's cost basis. The Company regularly
reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any
such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto,
and the Company's intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment's amortized cost basis. The Company's assessment on whether an investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain
education, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does
attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing
arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade
receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. 
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the ability to collect specific customer accounts and
includes consideration of the credit-worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. The Company also
records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels, and the aging of
such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a 
32 
major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts,
which would affect its results of operations in the period the adjustments are made.  Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase
Commitments  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The
Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed
review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, mobile communications
and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less favorable than forecasted or
if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were
recorded.  The Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled
or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically
cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of
the Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. 
Warranty Costs  The
Company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific
product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products
subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the
Company's results of operations.  The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system
software to maintain the software's compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in
determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.
Income Taxes 
The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with GAAP,
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax
assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, whereby the Company only recognizes the tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements
from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  
33 
Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that
may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the
net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities
involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on
the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Legal and Other Contingencies 
As discussed in Part II, Item1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Note 7 Commitments and
Contingencies in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records a liability when
it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In management's
opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. However, the outcomes
of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same
reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Net Sales 
The following table summarizes net sales and Mac unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during the three-
and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 (in millions, except unit sales in thousands and per unit amounts):  
35 
Net sales during the second quarter of 2010 and the first six months of 2010 increased $4.4
billion or 49%, and $8.2 billion or 39%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2009. Several factors contributed positively to this increase, including the following: 
36 
Segment Operating Performance 
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's operating and reporting segments consist of the
Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The
Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asia, but does not include Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in
international markets. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Note 8,
Segment Information and Geographic Data in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q.  Americas
Net sales in the Americas during the second quarter of 2010 increased $1.0 billion or 26% over the second quarter of 2009.
The increase in net sales during the second quarter of 2010 was attributable to increased iPhone revenue, strong demand for Mac desktop and portable systems, and higher iPod net sales due to strong demand for iPod touch. Also contributing to the
increase in net sales were higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store. Americas Mac net sales and unit sales increased 16% and 20%, respectively, during the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second
quarter of 2009. The Americas segment represented 37% and 44% of the Company's total net sales in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
During the first six months of 2010, net sales in the Americas segment increased $1.8 billion or 20% compared to the same period in 2009.
The increase in net sales during the first six months of 2010 was attributable primarily to the significant year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue, strong demand for Mac desktop and portable systems, and higher sales of third-party digital
content and applications from the iTunes Store. Also contributing to the increase in sales were higher iPod net sales due primarily to strong demand for iPod touch. The Americas segment represented approximately 38% and 44% of the Company's
total net sales for the first six months of 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Europe 
Net sales in Europe increased $1.6 billion or 63% during the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. The growth in
net sales was due mainly to the significant increase in iPhone revenue primarily attributable to country and carrier expansion and continued growth across existing carriers, strong demand for Mac desktop and portable systems, strength in the Euro
relative to the U.S. dollar, and higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store. Europe Mac net sales and unit sales increased 34% and 37%, respectively, during the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second
quarter of 2009. The Europe segment represented 30% and 27% of total net sales in the second quarter in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
For the first six months of 2010, net sales in Europe increased $3.0 billion or 49%, compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in
net sales during the first six months of 2010 was attributable primarily to the significant year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue, strong demand for Mac desktop and portable systems, and higher sales of third-party digital content and
applications from the iTunes Store. The Europe segment represented 31% and 29% of total net sales for the first six months in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Japan  Japan's net
sales increased $300 million or 51% during the second quarter of 2010 and increased $585 million or 54% during the first six months of 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The key contributors to Japan's net sales growth for both the
second quarter and first six months of 2010 were increased iPhone revenue, higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, and strength in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar. Mac unit sales grew in the
Japan segment by 18% and 13%, while Mac net sales declined by 2% and 6% during the second quarter of 2010 and first six months of 2010, respectively, due primarily to lower average selling prices compared to the same periods in 2009. The Japan
segment represented 7% of total net sales in both the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and 6% and 5% of total net sales in the first six months of 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
37 
Asia-Pacific 
Net sales in Asia Pacific increased $1.2 billion or 184% during the second quarter of 2010 and increased $2.3 billion or 161% during the
first six months of 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The growth in net sales was due mainly to the significant increase in iPhone revenue primarily attributable to country and carrier expansion and continued growth across existing
carriers, increased Mac portable and desktop systems, strong demand for iPod touch, as well as strengthening of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Also contributing to the increase in net sales were higher sales of third-party
digital content and applications from the iTunes Store. The Asia Pacific segment represented 14% and 7% of total net sales in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and 13% and 7% of total net sales in the first six months of 2010 and
2009, respectively.  Retail 
Retail net sales increased $306 million or 22% during the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. The increase in
net sales was driven by strong demand for Mac desktop and portable systems, higher sales of Mac-related accessories, and increased iPhone revenue, offset partially by a decrease in net sales of iPods. Mac net sales and unit sales grew in the Retail
segment by 28% and 38%, respectively, during the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. The Company opened three new retail stores during the second quarter of 2010, all of which were international stores, ending the quarter
with 286 stores open as compared to 252 stores at the end of the second quarter of 2009. With an average of 284 stores and 251 stores opened during the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $5.9
million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2009. The Retail segment represented 12% and 15% of total net sales in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Retail net sales grew $531 million or 17% during the first six months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due primarily to strong
demand for Mac desktop and portable systems, higher sales of Mac-related accessories, and increased iPhone revenue, offset partially by a decrease in net sales of iPods. Mac net sales and unit sales grew by 24% and 36%, respectively, during the
first six months of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Average revenue per store increased to $13.0 million for the first six months of 2010 based on an average of 281 stores, up from $12.5 million in the first six months of 2009 based on an average of
250 stores. The Retail segment represented 12% and 15% of total net sales for the first six months of 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
The Retail segment reported operating income of $373 million during the second quarter of 2010 compared to operating income of $317
million during the second quarter of 2009, and reported operating income of $854 million during the first six months of 2010 compared to $726 million during the first six months of 2009. The increase in Retail operating income year-over-year is
attributable to higher overall net sales and a higher gross margin percentage consistent with that experienced Company-wide, partially offset by higher operating costs. 
Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related
infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled $1.9 billion through the end of the second quarter of 2010. As of
March27, 2010, the Retail segment had approximately 18,500 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding lease commitments associated with retail space and related facilities of $1.7 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if
it were to close multiple retail stores and such costs could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
Gross Margin  Gross
margin for the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 was as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):  
38 
The gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2010 was 41.7% compared to 39.9% in the
second quarter of 2009 and the gross margin percentage for the first six months of 2010 was 41.2% compared to 38.8% for the first six months of 2009. These increases were largely driven by a more favorable sales mix towards products with higher
gross margins, primarily iPhone.  The Company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to
levels achieved during the first half of 2010 and anticipates gross margin levels of about 36% in the third quarter of 2010. This expected decline is largely due to the introduction of iPad, which has been aggressively priced, flat or reduced
average selling prices on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures that deliver greater value to customers, and both expected and potential future cost increases for key components. 
The foregoing statements regarding the Company's expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from
anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in Part II, Item1A, Risk Factors under the subheading Future operating results depend upon the Company's
ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities, which is incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that
targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing
pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company's sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In
response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to manage product quality
and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company's significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.
Operating Expenses 
Operating expenses for the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 were as follows (in millions,
except for percentages):  
Research and Development
(RD)  Expenditures for RD increased 34% or $107 million to $426 million during the three months ended
March27, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, and increased 30% or $190 million to $824 million during the six months ended March27, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. These increases were due primarily to an increase in
headcount in the current year to support expanded RD activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses. In addition, $23 million and $45 million of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard
and excluded from RD expense during the three- and six-month periods ended March28, 2009, respectively, while no software development costs were capitalized during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010. Although total
RD expense increased 34% and 30% during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010, compared to the same periods in 2009, respectively, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the revenue growth of 49% and
39%, respectively, during the same periods in 2009. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in RD are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of
new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to continue to invest in RD to remain competitive. 
39 
Selling, General, and Administrative (SGA) 
SGA expenditures increased $235 million or 24% to $1.2 billion during the three months ended March 27, 2010 compared to the same
period in 2009, and increased $432 million or 21% to $2.5 billion during the six months ended March 27, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. These increases were due primarily to the Company's continued expansion of its Retail segment,
higher spending on marketing and advertising, higher stock-based compensation expenses, and increased costs associated with the overall growth of the Company. 
Other Income and Expense 
Total other income and expense decreased $13 million or 21% to $50 million during second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of
2009, and decreased $138 million or 62% to $83 million during the first six months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The overall decrease in other income and expense is primarily attributable to the decline in interest rates during the
second quarter of 2010 as compared to the second quarter of 2009, partially offset by the Company's higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities decreased to 0.70% in the second quarter of 2010 from 1.53% in the second quarter of 2009. During the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any
related interest expense.  The Company's investment portfolio had gross unrealized gains of $75 million and $73 million
as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009, respectively, which were partially offset by gross unrealized losses of $18 million and $16 million as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009, respectively. As of March27, 2010
and September26, 2009, the gross unrealized gains related primarily to long-term marketable securities and the gross unrealized losses on the Company's marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates.
The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in
nature. The Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not the Company will be required to sell, any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Accordingly,no significant declines in fair value were
recognized in the Company's Condensed Statements of Operations during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009.The Company may sell its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for
strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no significant net gains or losses during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 related to
such sales.  Provision for Income Taxes 
The Company's effective tax rates for the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 were approximately 24% and 27%,
respectively, compared to approximately 32% and 31% for the three- and six-month periods ended March28, 2009, respectively. The Company's effective rates for both periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due
primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax rate during the second quarter of 2010 as compared to
the same quarter in 2009 is due primarily to an increase in foreign earnings on which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. 
The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the
years 2002 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to
audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If
any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009 (in
millions):  
40 
As of March27, 2010, the Company had $41.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities, an increase of $7.7 billion from September26, 2009. The principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $8.1 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of
property, plant and equipment of $650 million and payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $325 million. 
The Company's marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities with a minimum rating of
single-A. As of March27, 2010 and September26, 2009, $23.9 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively, of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, and other
liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.  Capital Assets 
The Company's cash payments for capital asset purchases were $650 million during the first six months of 2010, consisting of
approximately $148 million for Retail store facilities and $502 million for other capital asset purchases. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $2.0 billion for capital asset purchases during 2010, including approximately $400 million for
Retail store facilities and approximately $1.6 billion for real estate acquisitions, corporate facilities and infrastructure including information systems enhancements, and product tooling and manufacturing process equipment. 
Historically the Company has opened between 25 and 50 new retail stores per year. During 2010, the Company expects to open a number of
new stores near the upper end of this range, over half of which are expected to be located outside of the U.S.  Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities
whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a
variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.  Lease
Commitments  As of September26, 2009, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases
of $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion of which are related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. The Company's major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to
five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. Total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases related to the
lease of retail space increased to $1.7 billion as of March27, 2010.  Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component
Suppliers  The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's
products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.
The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open
orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. As of March27, 2010, the Company had
outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $4.9 billion.  The
Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. As of March27, 2010, the Company had a total of $971 million of inventory component prepayments outstanding, which is classified
as other current assets and other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
41 
Other Obligations 
Other outstanding obligations were $279 million as of March27, 2010, primarily related to advertising, research and development,
Internet and telecommunications services, and other obligations.  As of March27, 2010, the Company had gross
unrecognized tax benefits of $946 million and an additional $272 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits
is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12months. At this time, the Company is unable to make a
reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. 
Indemnifications  The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant
payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would
materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for indemnification costs as of either March27, 2010 or September26, 2009. 
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company
has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal
proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the
Company's financial condition or operating results.  
The Company's market risk profile has not changed significantly during the first six months of 2010. 
Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management 
The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its
underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset
more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given
period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
Interest Rate Risk 
While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, the fair value of those investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  
42 
The Company's investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and
supporting the liquidity requirements of the Company. A portion of the Company's cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company's investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. The Company's internal
portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance.  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's investment
policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date
of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument's underlying contractual maturity date. All short-term marketable securities have
maturities less than 12 months, while all long-term marketable securities have maturities greater than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration,
or for duration management. The Company recognized no significant net gains or losses during the three- and six-month periods ended March27, 2010 and March28, 2009 related to such sales. 
Foreign Currency Risk 
In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in
particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to
competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company may enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows,
and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign
exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. 
Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) were effective as of March27, 2010 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii)accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting  There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the
second quarter of 2010, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d)of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  
43 
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
As of
March27, 2010, the end of the quarterly period covered by this report, the Company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below, as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved
and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceeding or claim that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely
affect its financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved
against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2010 that did not individually or in
the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.  Branning et al. v. Apple
Computer, Inc.  Plaintiffs originally filed this purported class action against the Company in San Francisco County
Superior Court on February17, 2005 on behalf of putative classes of consumers and resellers. The case was transferred to Santa Clara Superior Court in May 2005. In general, the consumer plaintiffs allege that the Company shorted
the coverage provided under its warranties and AppleCare Protection Plan extended service contracts and sold plaintiffs used products that were represented to be new. In general, the reseller plaintiffs allege that the Company damaged their
businesses by opening the Apple retail stores and making misrepresentations in connection with doing so. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and other relief. On October28, 2009, the Court granted the consumer plaintiffs' motion to
certify a class relating to their shorting claims, but denied class certification as to their used as new claims. This case is currently pending. 
Harvey v. Apple Inc. 
Plaintiff filed this action against the Company on August6, 2007, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas alleging infringement by the Company of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,753,671 and 6,762,584. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and other relief. On October8, 2009, the case was transferred to the Northern District of California, where it is
currently pending.  Mediostream, Inc. v. Acer America Corp. et al.

Nokia Corporation v. Apple Inc.; Apple Inc. v. Nokia Corporation 
On October22, 2009, Nokia Corporation (Nokia) filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,802,465; 5,862,178; 5,946,651; 6,359,904; 6,694,135; 6,755,548; 6,882,727; 7,009,940; 7,092,672; and 7,403,621. The complaint alleges that these patents are essential to one
or more of the GSM, UMTS and 802.11 wireless communications standards, and that the Company has the right to license these patents from plaintiff on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions. Nokia seeks
unspecified FRAND compensation and other relief. The Company has asserted counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity as well as for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, antitrust violations, and Nokia's
infringement of Apple's U.S. Patent Nos. 5,634,074; 6,343,263; 5,915,131; 5,555,369; 6,239,795; 5,315,703; 6,189,034; 7,469,381; RE 39,486; 5,455,854; 7,383,453; 5,848,105; and 5,379,431. 
On December29, 2009, Nokia filed a complaint in the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) (the Nokia
ITC Action) requesting that the ITC conduct an investigation into whether certain iPhones, iPods and Apple computers infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,714,091; 6,834,181; 6,895,256; 6,518,957; 6,073,036; 6,262,735; and 6,924,789. 
On December29, 2009, Nokia filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
alleging infringement of the same patents that are the subject of the Nokia ITC Action. This case has been stayed pending the outcome of the Nokia ITC Action.  
44 
On January15, 2010, the Company filed a complaint in the ITC (the Apple ITC
Action) requesting that the ITC conduct an investigation into whether certain Nokiamobile communication devices and components thereof infringe certain claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,379,431; 5,455,599; 5,519,867; 5,915,131; 5,920,726;
5,969,705; 6,343,263; 6,424,354; and RE 39,486.  OPTi Inc. v. Apple Inc. 
Plaintiff filed this action against the Company on January16, 2007, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,710,906, 5,813,036, and 6,405,291. On April3, 2009, the Court ruled that the accused computers sold between 2005 and 2007 infringed the 291 patent. On April23, 2009, the jury
returned a verdict that the patent was valid and willfully infringed, and awarded $19 million in damages. On December3, 2009, the Court granted the Company's judgment as a matter of law on willfulness, denied plaintiff's motion for
enhanced damages and entered judgment against the Company for $21.7 million. The case is currently on appeal.  Saito
Shigeru Kenchiku Kenkyusho (Shigeru Saito Architecture Institute) v. iPod; Apple Japan Inc. v. Shigeru Saito Architecture Institute 
PlaintiffSaito filed a petition against the Company in the Japan Customs Office in Tokyo on January23, 2007, alleging
infringement by the Company of JapanesePatent No.3,852,854. The petition sought an order barring the importation into Japan of fifth generation iPods and second generation iPod nanos. The Customs Office rejected the petition to bar
importation and dismissed plaintiff's case.  Apple Japan, Inc. filed a Declaratory Judgment action against Saito on
February6, 2007, in the Tokyo District Court, seeking a declaration that the 854 patent is invalid and not infringed. Saito filed a Counter Complaint for infringement seeking damages. These cases are currently pending. 
St-Germain v. Apple Canada, Inc. 
Plaintiff filed this action against the Company in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on August5, 2005, as a putative class action for the
refund by the Company of the Canadian Private Copying Levy that was applied to the iPod purchase price in Quebec between December12, 2003 and December14, 2004, but later declared invalid by the Canadian Court. The Company has completed a
refund program for this levy. On January11, 2008, the Court ruled that despite the Company's good faith efforts with the levy refund program, the Company must pay the amount claimed. This case is currently on appeal. 
The Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation (formerly Charoensak v. Apple Computer, Inc. and Tucker v. Apple Computer, Inc.); Somers v.
Apple Inc.  The first-listed action is a consolidated case filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California combining two cases previously pending under the names Charoensak v. Apple Computer Inc. (formerly Slattery v. Apple Computer Inc., filed on January3, 2005) and Tucker v. Apple Computer, Inc. (filed
on July21, 2006). A Consolidated Complaint was filed on April17, 2007 on behalf of a purported class of direct purchasers of iPods and iTunes Store content, alleging various claims including alleged unlawful tying of music and video
purchased on the iTunes Store with the purchase of iPods and unlawful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly market power. The Court granted partial certification of plaintiffs' monopolization claims and subsequently de-certified these claims.
The Court also dismissed plaintiffs' tying claims. Plaintiffs subsequently filed an Amended Consolidated Complaint seeking unspecified damages and other relief pursuant to  2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 2), California
Business Professions Code 16700 et seq. (the Cartwright Act), California Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition), the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act and California monopolization law. This case
is currently pending.  A related complaint, Somers v. Apple Inc., was filed on December31, 2007, in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers, alleging various claims including alleged unlawful tying of music and videos purchased on the iTunes Store with the purchase of
iPods and vice versa and unlawful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly market power. The complaint alleges violations of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 and 2), California Business Professions Code
16700 et seq. (the Cartwright Act), California Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition), the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act and California monopolization law. Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and other
relief. This case is currently pending.  
45 
Tse v. Apple Computer, Inc. et al. 
Plaintiff filed this action against the Company and other defendants on August5, 2005, in the United States District Court for the
District of Maryland alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No.6,665,797. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The action was subsequently transferred to the Northern District of California. The case is currently stayed
pending the outcome of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reexamination of the asserted patent.  Vitt v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff filed this purported class action on November7, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California on behalf of a purported nationwide class of all purchasers of the iBook G4 alleging that the computer's logic board fails at an abnormally high rate. The complaint alleges violations of California Business
Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition) and California Business Professions Code 17500 (false advertising). The complaint seeks unspecified damages and other relief. This case is currently pending. 
Vogel et al. v. Jobs et al. 
On August24, 2006, plaintiffs filed a purported shareholder class action in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors, alleging improper backdating of stock option grants to maximize certain defendants' profits, failing to properly account for those grants and
issuing false financial statements. On June27, 2008, plaintiffs filed another, similar purported shareholder class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs' First Amended
ConsolidatedComplaint, filed on March22, 2010, asserts claims for unspecified damages against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors under the federal securities laws on behalf of a purported class of
shareholders. These cases have been consolidated and are currently pending.  
46 
Because of
the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not
use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  Economic conditions could materially adversely affect the
Company.  The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty
about current global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may continue to postpone spending inresponse to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have
a material negative effect on demand for the Company's products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company's expectations since the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to
offset the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit,
consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company's products and services and on the Company's financial
condition and operating results.  In the event of renewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and
financialmarkets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in the creditmarkets, low liquidity, andextreme
volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. In addition, the risk remains that therecould be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis onthe Company's business, including the insolvency of key
suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting inproduct delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to financepurchases of the Company's
products and/or customer, including channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the Company's treasury operations. Other income andexpense also could vary
materially from expectations depending on gains or lossesrealized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equitysecurities and other investments; interest
rates;cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economicuncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in thefuture on the
Company's financial instruments differing significantlyfrom the fair values currently assigned to them. 
Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of the Company's stock price.
Global markets for personal computers, mobile communication devices, digital music and video devices, and related
peripherals and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. 
The Company competes in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward
pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by
competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.  The Company's ability to compete successfully depends
heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its personal
computers, mobile communication devices, and consumer electronics, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research and development
and as such, the Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. By contrast, many of the Company's competitors seek to
compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the Company's intellectual
property, the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. 
47 
In the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number
of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. Consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. Price competition has been particularly
intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. The Company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government
and creative markets. An increasing number of Internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company's existing products. 
The Company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal
computer market, which is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. The Company's financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company's ability to continually improve
the Mac platform to maintain functional and design advantages. Use of unauthorized copies of the Mac OS on other companies' hardware products may result in decreased demand for the Company's hardware products, and could materially
adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company is currently focused on certain
mobile communication devices and consumer electronic devices and third-party digital content and applications distribution. The Company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other
resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company has only recently entered the
mobile communications market, and many of its competitors in the mobile communications market have significantly greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have
substantial resources and experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the
Company's approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. 
The Company currently receives subsidies from its exclusive and non-exclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone.
There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company's agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. 
There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. 
To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and
transitions.  Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer
electronics industries, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product
introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the
availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet
anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its
financial condition and operating results.  
48 
The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk. 
The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net
realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Although the Company believes its inventory
and other asset related provisions are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal computer, mobile communication, and consumer electronics industries, the
Company will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges. Such charges have, and could, materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with
industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and, where appropriate, prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. Such purchase commitments typically cover
forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days. Because the Company's markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order
or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products. The Company's financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to
manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  Future operating results depend
upon the Company's ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities. 
Because the Company currently obtains certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs,
certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from
multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, DRAM and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of
key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all,
upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. The follow-on effects from the credit crisis onthe Company's key suppliers, referred to in Economic conditions could materially adversely affect the
Company above, which is incorporated herein by reference, also could affect the Company's ability to obtain key components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases
that could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. The Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during the first half
of 2010, largely due to the introduction of iPad, which has been aggressively priced, flat or reduced average selling prices on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and both expected
and potential future cost increases for key components. For additional information refer to Part I, Item2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the subheading Gross
Margin, which is incorporated herein by reference.  The Company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile
communication and consumer electronics industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal
computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries. The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently
qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these
components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key
single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or  
49 
constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's
financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The Company depends on component and
product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S.  Most
of the Company's components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. Many of these manufacturers are located outside of the U.S., and are concentrated in several general locations. The Company has
also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished
control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company's flexibility to respond to changing conditions. In addition, the Company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the Company's supplier code of
conduct. Although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product
defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could materially adversely affect the Company's reputation, financial condition and operating results. 
Final assembly of the Company's products is currently performed in the Company's manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by
external vendors in California, Texas, China, the Czech Republic and Korea. Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the U.S., China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan,
Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Sole-sourced third-party vendors in China perform final assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable Mac products, iPhones, iPads, iPods and most of
the Company's desktop products. If manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental,
public health, or political issues, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. 
The Company relies on third-party digital content and applications, which may not be available to the Company on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.  The Company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content and
applications through the Company's iTunes Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to audio, video and other digital content. The Company's licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not
guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or
impossible for the Company to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. If the Company is unable to continue to
offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the Company's financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. 
Many third-party content providers require that the Company provide certain digital rights management (DRM) and other
security solutions. If these requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a
timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the Company to license its DRM, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the
Company's content providers.  The Company relies on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the
Company's future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights. 
Many of the Company's products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the Company may need to
seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods. Although the Company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no
assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all.  
50 
Because of technological changes in the global personal computer, mobile communication and
consumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other
intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. Regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense. At present, the Company
is vigorously defending a number of patent infringement cases, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance
can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If the Company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanent
injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the Company's financial condition and operating results could
be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology. While in management's opinion the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or
claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same
reporting period, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  With
the June 2007 introduction of iPhone, the Company has begun to compete with mobile communication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios.Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents orthe merits of
anypotential patent claims by competitors, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter into expensive agreements or settlements and/ormodify its products. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the
Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company's future performance depends on support from
third-party software developers. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products. 
The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its Macs, iPhones, iPads and iPods, are often
based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the Company's products on a
timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
With respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part
on the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the
perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company's minority share of the
global personal computer market causes developers to question the Company's prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing
and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. The Company's development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as Microsoft, Adobe and Google, to develop,
maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the Company's products. Since October 2007, Mac OS X has included a feature that enables Intel-based Mac systems to run Microsoft Windows operating systems. This feature may
deter developers from creating software applications for Mac OS X if such applications are already available for the Windows platform. 
With respect to iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and
innovative software applications. Unlike third-party software applications for Mac products, the software applications for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. The absence of
multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Company's customers, thereby causing
51 
developers to curtail significantly, or stop, development for the Company's platforms. In addition, iPhone, iPad and iPod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party
developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. Further, if the Company develops its own software applications and services, such
development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive applications for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch platforms. As with applications for the Company's Mac products,
the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers' perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Company's products rather than its competitors' products, including
devices that use competing platforms. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices may suffer. 
The Company's future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers. 
The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, value-added resellers, and
cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end-users, certain education customers, and certain
resellers through its online and retail stores. iPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers' distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. 
Many resellers operate on narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. Some
resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company's direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company's products. Such a perception could discourage resellers from investing
resources in the distribution and sale of the Company's products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial
condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's
products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs
could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.  The Company's
retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. 
Through March27, 2010, the Company had opened 286 retail stores. The Company's retail stores have required substantial fixed
investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of
which are for ten years. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations
and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company's more typical retail stores. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of
individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating
results.  Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company's control, pose risks and
uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail
activity, as well as the Company's inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners,
more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable
cost.  
52 
Investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company's
ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.  The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in
new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the
strategy, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company's due diligence. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful
and will not materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company's
products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin. 
The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in design and manufacture.
Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software's intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and
products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, harm to reputation,
and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
In certain countries, including the U.S., the Company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iPhone. 
In the U.S., Germany, Spain and certain other countries, the Company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular
network services for iPhone on an exclusive basis. If these exclusive carriers cannot successfully compete with other carriers in their markets on any basis, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services,
performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other terms of conditions of end-user contracts, or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iPhone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales
activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected.  The Company is subject to risks associated with
laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications devices.  Laws and regulations related to
mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes, whichcould include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture, distribution, and use
of the device, locking the device to a carrier's network, or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier's network, could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
Mobile communication devices, such as iPhones and certain iPads, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and
standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in
product shipment dates, which could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
The Company's success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. 
Much of the Company's future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its CEO, its
executive team and highly skilled employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where most
of the Company's key personnel are located. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to attract and retain key personnel. 
In addition, the Company has relied on equity awards in the form of stock options and restricted stock units as one means for recruiting
and retaining highly skilled talent. Significant adverse volatility in the Company's stock price could result in a stock option's exercise price exceeding the underlying stock's market value or a significant deterioration in the value
of restricted stock units granted, thus lessening the effectiveness of stock-based awards for retaining employees.  
53 
Political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other
circumstances could materially adversely affect the Company.  War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health
issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers,
manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company's business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health
issues, and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company's products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive
components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel
restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company's manufacturing
vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and
manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, the Company's financial
condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.  The Company may be subject to
information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.  Information technology system
failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors including without limitation earthquakes, fire, theft, or other causes could disrupt the Company's operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer,
including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the Company's online, iTunes, MobileMe and retail offerings and services, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial results,
resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information, or damage to the Company's reputation. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control
measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. 
The Company's profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company's software, accessories, and
service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company's other products. Gross margins on the Company's hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product
transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company's direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition,
the Company's gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases,
strengthening U.S. dollar, or price competition. The Company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season
and the beginning of the school year, respectively. Furthermore, the Company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months. Developments late in a quarter, such as
lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the
Company's financial condition and operating results.  
54 
The Company's stock price continues to be volatile. 
The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due to a number of factors, including but not limited to
variations between its actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by the Company and its competitors, and uncertainty about current global economic conditions. The stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance. Furthermore, the Company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and
profitability expectations. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline.  The Company's
business is subject to the risks of international operations.  The Company derives a large and growing portion of its
revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to the Company's international operations, including without limitation import and export requirements, the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in
foreign jurisdictions, and such costs may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. Furthermore, the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with
these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company's employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company's policies. Any such violations could individually or in the aggregate
materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition or operating results.  The Company's financial
condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities, including but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, political instability, and changes in the value of the U.S.
dollar versus local currencies. Margins on sales of the Company's products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties.  The
Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and certain parts of Asia, as well as non-U.S. dollar denominated operating expenses
incurred throughout the world. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the Company to
raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar's
strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the Company's
foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company's cost of product components
denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  The Company has used derivative instruments, such as
foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of
unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.  The Company is exposed to credit risk and
fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.  Although the Company has not recognized any material losses
on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. Given the global nature of its business,
the Company has investments both domestically and internationally. Additionally, the Company's overall investment portfolio has concentrations in the financial sector, which has been negatively impacted by adverse market liquidity conditions in
the recent past. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, 
55 
financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment,
which could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company is
exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. 
A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company
also has unsecured non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by contract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments
associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments,
there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 
The matters relating to the Company's past stock option practices and its restatement of consolidated financial statements may
result in additional litigation.  The Company's investigation into its past stock option practices and its restatement
of prior financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September30, 2006 gave rise to litigation and government investigations. As described in Part II, Item1, Legal Proceedings, several derivative
and class action complaints regarding stock options were filed against the Company and current and former officers and directors. These actions have been dismissed following a comprehensive settlement. Two former officers of the Company were also
named as defendants in an SEC enforcement action, which has been settled.  No assurance can be given that additional actions
will not be filed against the Company and current and former officers and directors as a result of past stock option practices. If such actions are filed and result in adverse findings, the remedies could materially adversely affect the
Company's financial condition and operating results.  Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the
Company.  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of
its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's
operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into material settlements. Should the Company fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of
these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might
materially affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company is subject to risks associated
with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection.  The Company's products and
services, and the production and distribution of those goods and services, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations. These may require the Company to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place
responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia and certain states
and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of its operations and the focus of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not materially
adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  
56 
Changes in the Company's tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. tax legislation or
exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect its future results.  The Company is subject to taxes in the United
States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company's future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and
liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the current administration and Congress have recently announced proposals for new U.S. tax legislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect the Company's tax rate.
Any of these changes could have a material adverse affect on the Company's profitability. The Company is also subject to the continual examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company
regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect
the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and
coverage of insurance.  For certain risks, the Company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or
availability.Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self-insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could materially adversely affect the Company's
financial condition and operating results.
