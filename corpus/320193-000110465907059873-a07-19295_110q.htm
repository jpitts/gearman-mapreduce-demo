Note 1 - Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
Apple Inc. and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries (Apple or the Company) designs, manufactures, and
markets personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile phones
and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking
solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores,
its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers,
resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety
of third-party Macintosh, iPod and iPhone compatible products including
application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and
various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores.
The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and
government customers.
Basis of Presentation and
Preparation
The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company. Intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the condensed consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.
These condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in
conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, included in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2006 (the 2006
Form 10-K).
The Company's fiscal year
is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The
Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2007 contained 13 weeks and the first
quarter of fiscal year 2006 contained 14 weeks. The Company's fiscal year 2007
will end on September 29, 2007 and include 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006
included 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or
quarters refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the
associated quarters of those fiscal years.
Revenue
Recognition
In March 2007, the
Company began shipping Apple TV and in June 2007 began shipping iPhone. For Apple TV and iPhone, the Company
indicated it may provide future unspecified features and additional software
products free of charge to customers. Accordingly,
Apple TV and iPhone handsets sales are accounted for under subscription
accounting in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition. As such,
the Company defers the associated revenue and cost of goods sold at the time of
sale, and recognizes both on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated
24-month economic life of these products.
Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, and marketing are
expensed as incurred.
The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that
are remitted to governmental authorities. These taxes are recorded as current
liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.
Software
Development Costs
Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be
sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning
when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when
a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.86, Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. In most
instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological
feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and
generally most software development costs have been expensed.
5 
In the second quarter of 2007, the Company determined that both Mac OS
X version 10.5 Leopard (Leopard) and iPhone achieved technological
feasibility. During the second and third quarters of 2007, the Company
capitalized approximately $27 million and $26 million, respectively, of costs
associated with the development of Leopard and iPhone. In accordance with SFAS
No.86, the capitalized costs related to Leopard and iPhone are amortized
to cost of sales commencing when each respective product begins shipping and
are recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life of
the underlying technology.
Earnings
Per Share
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share
is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would
have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been
issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, shares to be purchased
under the employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and
restricted stock units (RSUs) is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an
increase in the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a
greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock, and
RSUs. Additionally, the exercise of
employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and RSUs can result
in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):
Potentially
dilutive securities representing approximately 12.0 million and 3.0 million
shares of common stock for the quarters ended June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006,
respectively, and 13.2 million and 3.3 million shares of common stock for the
nine months ended June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, respectively, were excluded
from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because
their effect would have been antidilutive. Potentially dilutive securities
include stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase
plan, and RSUs.

Note 2 
Financial Instruments
Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
The following
table summarizes the fair value of the Company's cash and available-for-sale
securities held in its short-term investment portfolio, recorded as cash and
cash equivalents or short-term investments as of June 30, 2007, and September
30, 2006 (in millions): 
The Company's U.S.
Corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of
deposit, time deposits, and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities
consist primarily of foreign commercial paper issued by foreign companies, and
certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of
which are denominated in U.S. dollars. As of June 30, 2007 and September 30,
2006, approximately $2.1 billion and $921 million, respectively, of the
Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five
years. The remaining short-term
investments had maturities less than 12 months.
The gross and net
unrealized losses on the Company's investment portfolio were not significant as
of June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006. The unrealized losses on the Company's
investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities,
and foreign securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates. The Company typically invests in highly rated
securities with low probabilities of default.
The Company's investment policy requires investments to be rated
single-A or better. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be
temporary in nature. As of June 30, 2007, the Company does not consider the
investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
Market values were
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When
evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has
been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company's
ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be
sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses
derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk.
Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign
exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the
foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted
revenue and cost of sales. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a
majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures.
However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction
exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. The
Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the
instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the
balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges and
the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are adjusted to fair value through
earnings. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes
in value of fair value hedges are offset against the changes in fair value of
the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings. As of
June 30, 2007, the Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow
hedges of approximately $2.7 million, net of taxes, all of which is expected to
be reclassified to earnings by the end of the first quarter of 2008. As of the end of the third quarter of 2007,
the general nature of the Company's risk management activities and the general
nature and mix of the Company's derivative financial instruments have not
changed materially from the end of 2006.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company is currently

ranging from 3 to 10 years.
The following table
summarizes the components of gross and net intangible asset balances (in
millions):
Note 5  Shareholders' Equity
Preferred Stock
The Company has five
million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding.
Under the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board
of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of
preferred stock.
Restricted Stock Units
The Company's
Board of Directors has granted RSUs to members of the Company's senior
management team, excluding its CEO. These RSUs generally vest over four years
either at the end of the four-year service period, in two equal installments on
the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, or in equal
installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant
date. Upon vesting, the RSUs will
convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The compensation
expense incurred by the Company for RSUs is based on the closing market price
of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The RSUs have been
reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive
income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income.
Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element
of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other
comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from
those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative
instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Employee Benefit Plans
2003 Employee Stock Plan
The 2003 Employee
Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for
broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the
terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan
generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become
exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with
either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation
rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company's shareholders approved an
amendment to the 2003 Employee Stock Plan to increase the number of shares
authorized for issuance by 28 million shares.
1997 Employee Stock Option Plan
In August1997, the Company's Board of
Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a
non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are
not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants,
options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the
grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based
on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October
2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan and no new options can be granted
from this plan.
10 
1997
Director Stock Option Plan
In
August1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock
Option Plan (Director Plan) for non-employee directors of the Company, which
was approved by shareholders in 1998. Pursuant
to the Director Plan, the Company's non-employee directors are granted an
option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to
the Board (Initial Options). The Initial
Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each
of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth
anniversary of a non-employee director's initial election to the Board and on
each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to
receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (Annual Options).
Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of
grant.
Rule
10b5-1 Trading Plans
Certain of the
Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter
Oppenheimer, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, and Dr. Bertrand Serlet, have entered into
trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the
amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and
dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the
exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the
Company's employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum
of $25,000 in any calendar year. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company's shareholders approved an
amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares
authorized for issuance by 6 million shares and limit the number of shares that
may be purchased in any calendar year to 3 million shares. As of June 30, 2007, approximately 7.0
million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.
Stock Award Activity
A summary of the
Company's stock award activity and related information for the nine months
ended June 30, 2007 is set forth in the following table (stock award amounts
and aggregate intrinsic value are presented in thousands):
Beginning in April
2005, each RSU granted under the 2003 Plan has reduced the number of shares
available for grant under that plan by two shares.
11 
Aggregate
intrinsic value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on
the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average
exercise price multiplied by the number of shares underlying the outstanding
options. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $349 million
and $961 million for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2007,
respectively, and $171 million and $1.1 billion for the three and nine-month
periods ended July 1, 2006, respectively.
The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was
$21 million and $49 million for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30,
2007, respectively, and $10 million and $36 million for the three and
nine-month periods ended July 1, 2006. As
of June 30, 2007, $675 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related
to stock options and RSUs is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 3.03 years.
As of June 30,
2007, the Company had 4.67 million RSUs outstanding with a total grant-date
fair value of $245 million, which were excluded from the options outstanding
balances in the preceding table. No RSUs
were granted or vested during the third quarter of 2007. The weighted-average grant date fair value of
RSUs granted during the first nine months of 2007 was $86.67. Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs at June 30,
2007 was $570 million.
There were no
grants or forfeitures of restricted stock during the three or nine-month
periods ended June 30, 2007. There was
no outstanding restricted stock as of June 30, 2007.
The Company uses
the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model to calculate the fair
value of stock-based awards. The BSM
incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and
interest rates. The expected volatility
is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the
most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the
Company's stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility
in market traded options on the Company's common stock. The Company bases its expected
life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of
the stock awards it grants to employees.
The assumptions
used for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006
and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of
options granted and for stock purchases during those periods are as follows:
Note 6 
Commitments and Contingencies
Lease Commitments
The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail
space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not
currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major
facility leases are for terms of 5 to 15 years and generally provide renewal
options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for
terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often
contain multi-year renewal options. As
of September 30, 2006, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases were $1.2 billion, of which $887 million related
to leases for retail space. As of June
30, 2007, total future minimum lease payments related to leases for retail
space increased $113 million to $1.0 billion.
12 
Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications
The following
table reconciles changes in the Company's accrued warranties and related costs
for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006 (in
millions):
The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating
system and application software against legal claims that the software
infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered
into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which
the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,
the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting
from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential
liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification
that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. Therefore, the
Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either June 30,
2007 or September 30, 2006.
Concentrations
in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product
Certain key
components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain
LCDs, certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited
sources which subjects the Company to supply and pricing risks. Many of these
and other key components that are available from multiple sources including,
but not limited to, NAND flash memory, DRAM memory, and certain LCDs, are at
times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing
fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for
the supply of critical components at favorable pricing, and there is no
guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements
when they expire. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks
of supply shortages and/or price increases that can adversely affect gross
margins and operating margins. In addition, the Company uses some components
that are not common to the rest of the global personal computer and consumer
electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often
utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has
evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional
suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced
component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key
manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the
Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a
timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial
performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to
obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and
obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability
of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate
on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet
the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's
CPUs, iPods, iPhones, logic boards, and other assembled products are now
manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A
significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently
performed by only a few of the Company's outsourcing partners, often in single
locations. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on
manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be adversely
affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production
commitments.
Long-Term Supply Agreements
During the first
quarter of 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with
Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash
memory through calendar year 2010. As
part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory
components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases
made over the life of each respective agreement. Approximately $142 million of
the prepayment had been utilized by the Company as of June 30, 2007.
13 
Contingencies
The Company is
subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the
ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion
of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any
current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity,
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
Production and
marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company
to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations
and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or
future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
condition, liquidity, or results of operations.
Note 7 - Segment Information and Geographic Data
In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company reports
segment information based on the management approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and
assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.
Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are generally
based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe,
Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail, and FileMaker operations. The Company's four
geographical segments, together with the Retail segment, all sell the same
products to the same types of customers. The Company's reportable operating
segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail operations.
The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments exclude activities related
to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South
America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle
East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the
U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K., and Italy. Other operating segments include
Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the
Company's subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc.
Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware
and software products and similar services, and as of June 30, 2007 the
accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in
the Company's 2006 Form 10-K in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies.
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based
on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
generally based on the location of the customers, and net sales for the Retail
segment are based on sales from the Company's retail stores. Operating income
for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales,
and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising
expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the
expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other
income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments.
Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses
such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs,
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based
compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other
separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not
include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets such as cash, short-term and
long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate
infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store
construction-in-progress not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail
segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $88
million and $54 million during the third quarters of 2007 and 2006,
respectively, and $164 million and $136 million during the first nine months of
2007 and 2006, respectively.
14 
From the establishment of
the Retail segment in fiscal 2001 through the quarter ended March 31, 2007,
Company management assessed the segment's operating performance differently
from the Company's other operating segments. Because the Company's Retail
initiative was an unproven concept at inception, management chose to measure
the Retail segment's performance in a manner that would allow comparability to
the Company's major channel partners operating retail stores in the U.S. There
were three significant differences in the measurement of the Retail segment's
results relative to the Company's other operating segments. First, the Retail
segment's operating income reflected cost of sales for Apple products at
amounts normally charged to Apple's major U.S. channel partners for the same
products, less the cost of the Company's sales programs and other costs to
support those partners. Second, the cost of sales of the Company's service and
support contracts, including the AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) and .Mac,
were reflected in the Retail segment's results at the costs charged to major
channel partners for such contracts, and all associated revenue was reflected
in the Retail segment's results at the time of sale rather than being amortized
over the lives of the respective agreements. Because the Company had not yet
earned the revenue or incurred the cost associated with the sale of such
contracts, an offset to these amounts was recognized in other segments' net
sales and cost of sales. Third, the Company allocated certain expenses related
to the operation of its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense.
Having operated the
Company's Retail stores successfully for more than six years, management
believes its Retail initiative is a proven concept that will continue to be an
integral element of the Company's distribution and marketing strategies. Additionally,
the Company expects sales of iPhone by the Company's geographic operating
segments to generate significant levels of deferred revenue and deferred cost
of sales over time. In consideration of these factors, management has
determined that beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2007, aligning
measurements for the performance of the Retail segment with those used for the
Company's other operating segments provides the most meaningful information.
Accordingly, management has begun to measure the Retail segment's operating
performance in a manner generally consistent with the Company's other operating
segments. The cost of sales of the Company's products sold through the Retail
segment is now reflected at amounts similar to the cost of sales of the same
products reflected in the Company's other operating segments. Revenue from APP
and .Mac contracts sold through the Retail segment is now being recognized over
the lives of the respective service agreements. Additionally, the Retail
segment is applying the same subscription accounting to iPhone net sales and
cost of sales that the Company's other operating segments apply. Management
believes aligning measurements for the performance of the Retail segment with
those used for the Company's other operating segments will provide greater
comparability with the rest of the Company's segments and allow for more
meaningful assessment of the Retail segment's operating results. The Company
has reclassified prior period operating segment results to reflect these changes
in the measurement of the operating results for the Retail segment, along with
the corresponding offsetting impact to the Company's other operating segments.
The Company will continue to allocate certain
operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. These
high-profile stores are larger than the Company's typical retail stores and
were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for
certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate
briefings. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is
based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that
incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a
total of eight high-profile stores as of June 30, 2007. Expenses allocated to
corporate marketing resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were
$10 million and $9 million in the third quarters of 2007 and 2006, respectively,
and $30 million and $24 million for the first nine months of 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Executive Overview
The Company
designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, portable digital music
players, and mobile phones and sells a variety of related software, services,
peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company's products and services
include the Macintosh line of desktop and portable computers, the iPod line of
portable digital music players, iPhone, Apple TV, Xserve, and Xserve RAID, a
portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X
operating system, third-party digital content through the iTunes Store, and a
variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its
products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct
sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers.
In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh, iPod and
iPhone compatible products including application software, printers, storage
devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies
through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer,
creative professional, business, and government customers. Further discussion of
the Company's products may be found below under the heading Products and Part
II, Item 1A., Risk Factors, as well as in Part I, Item 1., Business of the
Company's 2006 Form 10-K.
The Company believes that
for both consumers and professionals the personal computer has become the
center of an evolving digital lifestyle by integrating and enhancing the
utility of advanced digital devices such as the Company's iPods, iPhones,
digital video and still cameras, televisions, CD and DVD players, and other
consumer electronic devices. The attributes of the personal computer that
enable this functionality include a high-quality user interface, easy access to
relatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications,
and the ability to connect easily to a wide variety of other digital devices
and to the Internet. The Company is the only participant in the personal
computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire
personal computer  from the hardware and operating system to sophisticated
applications. This, along with its products' innovative industrial designs,
intuitive ease-of-use, built-in graphics, multimedia and networking
capabilities, uniquely positions the Company to offer innovative integrated
digital lifestyle solutions.
The Company's business
strategy leverages its ability, through the design and development of its own
operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to
bring to its customers around the world compelling new products and solutions
with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial
design.
17 
The Company
participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal
computers with its Macintosh line of computers, consumer electronics with its
iPod product family of portable digital music players, and distribution of
third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. With the
introduction of iPhone, the Company has also begun to compete with mobile
communication device companies that have substantial experience and
technological and financial resources.
While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the
personal computer and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the
emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly
competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the
Company believes that increased investment in research and development
(RD) and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand
its position in the markets where it competes.
The Company's RD spending is focused on further developing its
existing line of personal computers, operating systems, software applications,
and portable digital music players; developing new digital lifestyle consumer
and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas such
as iPhone and wireless technologies. The
Company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising
programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.
The Company
utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative
and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can
convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration,
demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on
Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Macintosh with
the Windows platform and networks. The
Company further believes that providing a high-quality sales and after-sales
support experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience
for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has
expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail
stores in the U.S. and internationally.
The Company had 185 stores open as of June 30, 2007.
The Company also
staffs selected third-party stores with the Company's own employees to improve
the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees and
contractors in reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Canada,
Europe, Japan, Asia and Australia. The Company also sells to customers directly
through its online stores around the world.
To improve access
to the iPod product family, the Company has significantly expanded the number
of distribution points where iPods are sold. iPods can be purchased in certain
department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and
specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels listed above.
iPhone is
currently distributed in the United States through the Company's online and
retail stores as well as stores owned and operated by ATT.
Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and results of operations require the Company's management
to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported
in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note
1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2006 Form
10-K and Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in
this Form 10-Q describes the significant accounting policies and methods used
in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such
differences may be material.
Management
believes the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those
related to revenue recognition, allowance
for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments,
warranty costs, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. Management believes
these policies to be critical because they are both important to the
portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and they require
management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently
uncertain. The Company's senior management has reviewed these critical
accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.
18 
Revenue Recognition
Net sales consist
primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, peripherals, digital
content, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for
software products (operating system software and applications software), or any
product that is considered to be software-related in accordance with the
guidance in EITF No. 03-5, Applicability of American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 97-2
to Non-software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental
Software, (e.g., Macintosh computers, iPod portable digital music
players and iPhone) pursuant to AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. For products that are not software or
software-related, (e.g., digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain
Macintosh and iPod supplies and accessories) the Company recognizes revenue
pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue
Recognition.
The Company
recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is
probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been
shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these
criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some
sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the
Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If
at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is
not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and
subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other
criteria for revenue recognition have been met.
The Company began
shipping Apple TV in March 2007 and iPhone in June 2007. For both Apple TV and iPhone, the Company may
provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of
charge to customers. Therefore, sales of
Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under subscription accounting in
accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2. The Company recognizes the associated revenue
and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently-estimated
24-month economic lives of these products.
Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, and marketing are
expensed as incurred.
The Company
records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price
protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user
rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection,
the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded,
provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the
other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. If refunds cannot be reliably estimated,
revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price
protection lapses. For customer
incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the
later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at
which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue
for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical
experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the
Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price
protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at
the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive
programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will
actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific
terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than
estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be
required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have a
material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.
Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts
The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors
and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial
customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its
customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to
limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt
to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain
customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with
third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan
and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing
arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end
customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit
risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by
collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners.
19 
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration
of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers.  The Company records an allowance to reduce
the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be
collectible.
The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables
based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad
debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the
Company's distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables.  If there is a deterioration of a major
customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional
information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future
actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those
currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for
doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments
were made.
Inventory
Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments
The Company must order components for its products and build inventory
in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for
inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for
resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or
net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each
fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product
life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and
component cost trends. The personal computer
and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable
pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future
demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less favorable than
forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility
of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional
write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the
write-downs were recorded.
The Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to
component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled.
Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a
combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on
projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30
to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or
more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological
requirements for any of the Company's products, the Company may be
required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would
negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are
identified and recorded.
Warranty Costs
The Company
provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the
time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected
warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of
specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience.
Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of
its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of
products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual
product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the
estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively
affect the Company's results of operations.
The Company
periodically provides updates to its applications and system software in order
to maintain the software's compliance with specifications. The estimated cost
to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at
the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in
determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of
units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical
cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these
updates.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS
No. 123R), Share-Based Payment. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the
award's fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)
option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite
service period. The BSM model requires various
highly judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and
expected option life. If any of the
assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based
compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in
the current period.
20 
Income
Taxes
The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences
of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes
is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected
to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be
realized.
Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning
strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will
be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net
deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an
adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the
period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax
liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of
uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the
Company's results of operations and financial position.
Products
The Company offers
a range of personal computing products including desktop and portable personal
computers, related devices and peripherals, and various third-party hardware
products. In addition, the Company
offers software products including Mac OS X, the Company's proprietary
operating system software for the Macintosh; server software and related
solutions; professional application software; and consumer, education and
business oriented application software. The Company also designs, develops and
markets to Macintosh and Windows users its family of iPod digital music players
along with related accessories and services including the online distribution
of third-party content through the Company's iTunes Store.
In January 2007,
the Company announced iPhone, a handheld
device that combines in a single product a mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with
touch controls, and an Internet communications device. iPhone's
user interface is based on the Multi-Touch display allowing users to control
the device with their fingers.iPhone lets users make a call by
pointing at a name or number in their address book, a favorites list, or a call
log as well asselect and listen to voicemail messages in whatever order
they want. iPhonealso allows users to play their iTunes content,
including movies, television shows, music, photos and podcasts, with the touch
of a finger.iPhone featuresdesktop-class email, web browsing,
searching, and maps. iPhone is compatible with a Mac or PC and

to 8 hours of talk time, 6 hours of Internet use, 7 hours of video playback or
24 hours of audio playback. ATT Mobility LLC (formerly Cingular
Wireless LLC) is the exclusive U.S. carrier for iPhone. The Company began
shipping iPhone in the U.S. on June 29, 2007.
In January 2007,
the Company announced Apple TV, a device
that permits users to wirelessly play iTunes content on a widescreen
television. Compatible with a Mac or PC,
Apple TV includes either a 40GB or 160GB hard drive capable of storing up to
200 hours of video, 36,000 songs, 25,000 photos, or a combination of each and
is capable of displaying content in high definition resolution up to 720p.
Apple TV connects to a broad range of widescreen televisions and home theater
systems and comes
standard with HDMI, component video, and both analog and digital optical audio
ports. Using high-speed AirPort 802.11 wireless networking, Apple TV can
auto-sync content from one computer or stream content from up to five
additional computers directly to a television.
The Company began shipping Apple TV in March 2007.
A detailed discussion of
the Company's other products may be found in its 2006 Form 10-K.

Net Sales
The first nine
months of 2007 spanned 39 weeks while the first nine months of 2006 spanned 40
weeks. This additional week is added to the first fiscal quarter
approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar
quarters.
Net sales and
Macintosh unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by
product follow (net sales in millions and unit sales in thousands):
Notes:
(a) In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the
Company revised the way it measures the Retail Segment's operating results to a
manner that is generally consistent with the Company's other operating
segments. Prior period results have been
reclassified to reflect this change to the Retail Segment's operating results
along with the corresponding offsets to the other operating segments. Further
information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part I,
Item 1., Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 7, Segment Information and
Geographic Data.
(b) Other Segments include
Asia Pacific and FileMaker.
(c) Includes iMac, eMac, Mac mini, Mac Pro,
Power Mac, and Xserve product lines.
22 
(d) Includes MacBook, iBook,
MacBook Pro, and PowerBook product lines.
(e) Consists of iTunes Store
sales, iPod services, and Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories.
(f) Consists of iPhones
and Apple-branded and third-party iPhone accessories.
(g) Includes sales of
Apple-branded and third-party displays, wireless connectivity and networking
solutions, and other hardware accessories.
(h) Includes sales of
Apple-branded operating system software, application software, third-party
software, AppleCare, and Internet services.
(i) Derived by dividing
total Macintosh net sales by total Macintosh unit sales.
(j) Derived by dividing
total iPod net sales by total iPod unit sales.
Net sales during the third
quarter of 2007 increased 24% or $1.0 billion from the same period in 2006, and
were up 23% or $3.3 billion for the first nine months of 2007 compared to the
same period in 2006 even though the first nine months of 2007 spanned 26 weeks
while the first nine months of 2006 spanned 27 weeks. Several factors
contributed to these increases including the following:
Macintosh
net sales increased $667 million or 36% during the third quarter of 2007 and
increased $2.0 billion or 40% during the first nine months of 2007 compared to
the same periods in 2006. Macintosh unit
sales increased by 437,000 units or 33% during the third quarter of 2007 and
increased 1.194 million units or 32% during the first nine months of 2007
compared to the same periods in 2006. The
increases in Macintosh net sales and unit sales were driven by higher sales of
portable products, especially sales of the MacBook that increased in all of the
Company's operating segments, as well as increased sales of the MacPro and iMac
in most operating segments. The Macintosh unit growth rate of 33% in the third
quarter of 2007 is higher than the projected PC industry average growth rate
for the quarter and reflects strong growth in customer demand for the Company's
Macintosh products. Net sales and unit sales of the Company's portable products
increased 36% and 42%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2007, and
increased 62% and 59%, respectively, during the first nine months of 2007 compared
to the same periods in 2006. This growth was attributable to increased sales of
both the MacBook, which began shipping in May 2006, and the MacBook Pro, which
began shipping in February 2006. Both of
these products were updated in the third quarter of 2007. Macintosh desktop net sales and unit sales
increased by 36% and 20%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2007
compared to the same period in 2006 due to strong sales of both the iMac and
Mac Pro. Macintosh desktop net sales and
unit sales increased by 15% and 5%, respectively during the first nine months
of 2007. Macintosh desktop net sales
grew faster than unit sales during this period due to increased sales of the
higher-priced 24-inch iMac and Mac Pro and a shift in product mix away from the
lower-priced Mac mini and the discontinued eMac products. Net sales per
Macintosh unit sold increased by 2% and 6% for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2007, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2006 primarily
due to a shift in product mix to higher-priced portable products, the
introduction of the Mac Pro in August 2006, and the discontinuation of the
lower-priced eMac.
Net sales of iPods increased $73 million or
5% during the third quarter of 2007 and increased $569 million or 9% during the first nine
months of 2007 compared to the same periods in 2006. Unit sales of iPods increased 21% and 35%
during the third quarter and first nine months of 2007, respectively, compared
to the same periods in 2006. Strong
sales of iPods during the first nine months of 2007 were driven largely by iPod nano and iPod shuffle that were updated in
September 2006. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2007,
the net sales per iPod unit sold decreased by 14% and 19%, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2006 primarily due to a shift in product mix
towards the lower-priced iPod shuffle and price reductions taken in September
2006 on the Company's iPod product offerings.
Net sales of
iPhone and related products and services were $5 million during the third
quarter of 2007. iPhone revenue included in net sales reflects only the portion
recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over iPhone's 24-month
estimated economic life. In the third
quarter of 2007, commencing with the June 29 launch, iPhone unit sales were
270,000.
Net sales of
other music related products and services increased $151 million or 33% during
the third quarter of 2007 and increased $462 million or 32% during the first
nine months of 2007 compared to the same periods in 2006 due to increased net
sales from the iTunes Store. The Company believes this growth was the result of
heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion
of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store.
23 
Net sales of peripherals and other hardware
increased $72 million or 31% during the third quarter of 2007 and rose $111
million or 14% during the first nine months of 2007 compared to the same
periods in 2006 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other
hardware accessories, including printers and scanners, which for the nine
months ended June 30, 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of
displays.
Net
sales of software, service, and other sales rose $72 million or 23% during the
third quarter of 2007 and rose $115 million or 12% during the first nine months
of 2007 compared to the same periods in 2006. This growth for the three and
nine-month periods was primarily attributable to increased net sales of
AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended service and support contracts and
increased sales of Apple branded and third-party developers' software products.
Segment Operating Performance
The Company
manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable
operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail.
The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities
related to the Retail segment. The
Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail
segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, the
U.K., and Italy. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the Retail
operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar
services. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company revised the way it
measures the Retail Segment's operating results to a manner that is generally
consistent with the Company's other operating segments. Prior period results have been reclassified
to reflect this change to the Retail Segment's operating results along with the
corresponding offsets to the other operating segments. Further information
regarding the Company's operating segments and the current quarter's change in
measurement of Retail operating results may be found in Part I, Item 1.,
Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 7, Segment Information and
Geographic Data.
Americas
Net sales in the Americas segment during the third quarter of 2007
increased $467 million or 21% and Macintosh unit sales increased by 28%
compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in net sales during the third
quarter of 2007 was primarily due to an increase in sales of Macintosh portable
and desktop systems as well as content from the iTunes Store. During the third
quarter of 2007, the Americas segment represented approximately 50% of the
Company's total net sales, relatively unchanged from the same period in 2006.
For the first nine months of 2007, net sales in the Americas segment
increased $1.6 billion or 23% compared to the same period in 2006, while
Americas Macintosh unit sales increased 24% over the same period in 2006. The
increase in net sales during the first nine months of 2007 was primarily attributable
to the year-over-year increase in sales of the Company's portable and desktop
systems, iPods and content from the iTunes Store. The Americas segment
represented approximately 49% of the Company's total net sales for both the
first nine months of 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Europe
Net sales in Europe increased $260 million or 29% during the third quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in
2006. Macintosh unit sales in Europe
increased 31% on a year-over-year
basis. These increases were mainly a
result of growth in sales of all of the Company's Macintosh portable and
desktop systems, as well as iPods and content from the iTunes Store.
For the first nine months of 2007, net sales in
Europe increased by $1.0 billion or 33% compared to the same period in 2006. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe
increased 31% on a year-over-year
basis. These increases were mainly a
result of growth in net sales of Macintosh portable systems and iMacs, iPods,
and content from the iTunes Store.
24 
Japan
Japan's net sales were essentially flat during the
third quarter of 2007 and declined $98 million or 11% during the first nine
months of 2007 compared to the same periods in 2006. Total Macintosh unit sales
in Japan increased 3% year-over-year
during the third quarter of 2007 but decreased by 5% year-over-year for the
first nine months of 2007. The decrease in net sales for the first nine months
of 2007 was due to a decrease in net sales of Macintosh desktop systems,
MacBook Pro, and iPods, partially offset by an increase in net sales of the
MacBook. Although iPod unit sales were
relatively flat for the nine months of 2007 compared to the same period in
2006, net sales of iPods decreased due to price reductions in September 2006 on
the Company's iPod product offerings and due to a shift in mix towards lower
priced iPod shuffles. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways to
improve the future results of its Japan segment.
Retail
During
the third quarter of 2007, the Company opened 8 new retail stores. The Company had 185 retail stores open at the
end of the third quarter of 2007 compared to 155 stores at the end of the third
quarter of 2006. Retail net sales grew by 33% during the third quarter of 2007
compared to the same period in 2006 due to strong growth in sales of Macintosh
products. Macintosh unit sales increased by 53% due to strong demand for the
MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac.
Strong growth in iPod unit sales was offset by lower average selling prices
resulting from price reductions in September of 2006. Average quarterly revenue per store increased to $5.1 million in the
third quarter of 2007 from $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2006. Retail net
sales grew by 21% during the first nine months of 2007 due to an increase in
Macintosh unit sales resulting from strong demand for the Company's MacBook,
MacBook Pro, and iMac as well as
service and software partially,
offset by a decrease in net sales of iPods and music related accessories.
Average revenue per store decreased to
$16.5 million for the first nine months of 2007, from $17.2 million in the
first nine months of 2006 primarily due to lower iPod sales resulting from lower iPod price points and expanded and well-supplied channel
distribution. as well as the impact
of an additional week included in
the first nine months of 2006.
The Retail segment reported a
profit of $184 million during the third quarter of 2007 compared to a profit of
$122 million during the third quarter of 2006. The segment reported a profit of
$607 million during the first nine months of 2007 compared to a profit of $444
million during the first nine months of 2006. The increased profit in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2007 was due to the addition of new stores and
higher Macintosh net sales, partially offset by increased spending on store
remodeling and personnel and a reduction in iPod net sales.
Expansion of the Retail segment
has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed
assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and
other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail
segment since its inception totaled $893 million through the end of the third
quarter of 2007.
As of June 30, 2007, the Retail segment had approximately 7,300
full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding lease commitments associated
with retail space of $1.0 billion.
Gross
Margin
Gross margin for
the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006 was as
follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):
Gross margin percentage
for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 was 36.9% and 34.1%,
respectively, compared to 30.3% and 28.9%, for the comparable periods of 2006,
respectively. The year-over-year increase in gross margin percentage during the
third quarter of 2007 was primarily due to favorable costs of certain commodity
components (including LCD flat-panel displays and NAND flash memory), favorable
product mix, and higher overall revenue resulting in more effective leverage on
fixed production costs.
25 
A significant
portion of the gross margin improvement in the third quarter of 2007 was due to
excess supply in the market for memory and other components. This excess supply
in the market has begun to be absorbed and prices of many components have begun
to increase. The Company expects this will result in a lower gross margin
percentage for the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to the third quarter of
2007. The Company also expects gross
margin to be negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 2007 by its
back-to-school promotion and product transitions.
Over the longer
term, the Company anticipates that its gross margin percentage will be below
third quarter 2007 levels due to product sales price competition, changes in
product mix and higher component costs across the Company's product lines.
The foregoing
statements regarding the Company's expected gross margins for the fourth
quarter of 2007 and future periods are forward-looking. Gross margin could
differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including certain of
those set forth below in Part II, Item 1A., Risk Factors. There can be no
assurance that the Company will achieve its expected gross margin levels.
Operating
Expenses
Operating expenses
for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006 were
as follows (in millions, except for percentages):
Research
and Development (RD)
Expenditures for RD
increased 19% or $33 million to $208 million in the third quarter of 2007
compared to the same period in 2006, and increased 8% or $42 million to $575
million compared to the first nine months of 2006. RD expense for the three and
nine months ended June 30, 2007 does not include capitalized software
development costs of approximately $26 million and $53 million, respectively,
related to the development of Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone. The increases in RD expense were
primarily due to an increase in RD headcount in the current year to
support expanded RD activities, partially offset by one less week of
expenses in the first quarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development
costs mentioned above. The Company continues to believe that focused
investments in RD are critical to its future growth and competitive
position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of
new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business
strategy. As such, the Company expects
to increase spending in RD to remain competitive.
Selling,
General, and Administrative Expense (SGA)
Expenditures for
SGA increased $162 million or 28% and $332 million or 18%, respectively,
for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2007, compared to the same
periods in 2006. The increases were
primarily due to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling expenses
resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales for
both the third quarter and first nine months of 2007, the Company's continued
expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, and
a current year increase in spending on marketing and advertising, partially
offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007.
Other Income and Expense
Other income and
expense for the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and July 1,
2006 were as follows (in millions):
Total other income
and expense increased $60 million or 63% during the third quarter of 2007
compared to the same period in 2006, and increased $177 million or 70% during
the first nine months of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The increases were attributable primarily to
higher cash and short-term investment balances and increased investment yields
resulting from higher market interest rates. The weighted-average interest rate
earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
increased to 5.27% in the third quarter of 2007 from 4.77% in the third quarter
of 2006.
26 
Provision
for Income Taxes
The Company's effective
tax rate for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2007 was approximately
32% and 31%, respectively, compared with approximately 29% and 31% for the three and nine
months ended July 1, 2006. The Company's
effective rate for both periods differs from the statutory federal income tax
rate of 35% primarily due to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which
no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely
reinvested outside the U.S. The tax rate for the three months ended June
30, 2007, differs from the same period in 2006 due to a net tax benefit
recorded in the third quarter of 2006 resulting from the repatriation of
foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act and the implementation of
certain tax planning strategies associated with the repatriation.
The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) has substantially completed its field audit of the
Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and
proposed certain adjustments. The
Company intends to contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals
Office. Substantially all IRS audit
issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits
by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax
examinations. However, the outcome of
tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty.
Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a
manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be
required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution
occurs.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2007,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
(SFAS No.159), including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS
No.159 allows companies to choose to elect to measure eligible financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be
measured at fair value. SFAS No. 159 requires that unrealized gains and losses
on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in
earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by
the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to
evaluate the application of SFAS No. 159, management does not currently believe
adoption will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or
financial position.
In September 2006, the
SEC issued SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements. SAB No.
108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when
quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of
determining whether the current year's financial statements are materially
misstated. SAB No. 108 is effective for
fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by
the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Although the Company will continue to
evaluate the application of SAB No. 108, management does not currently believe
adoption will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or
financial position.
In September 2006, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which
defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to
other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does
not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by
the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company
will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 157, management does not
currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company's results
of operations or financial position.
In June 2006, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a
framework for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in
their financial statements uncertain tax positions that they have taken or
expect to take in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning
in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Although the Company will continue to
evaluate the application of FIN 48, management does not currently believe
adoption will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or
financial position.
27
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2007, the Company had $13.8 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $3.7 billion over the
same balance at the end of September 30, 2006. The principal components of this
net increase were cash generated by operating activities of $3.8
billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $294
million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $303
million. These increases were partially
offset by purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $530 million and
payments for acquisitions of intangible assets of $222 million. The Company's short-term investment portfolio is
primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid investments. Additionally, the
Company's working capital was $11.8 billion as of June 30, 2007 compared to
$8.0 billion as of September 30, 2006.
The Company believes its existing balances of cash,
cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to
satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding
commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing
operations over the next 12 months.
Capital Expenditures
The Company's
total capital expenditures were $530 million during the first nine months of
2007, consisting of $164 million for retail store facilities and $366 million
for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information
systems enhancements. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize
approximately $850 million for capital expenditures during 2007, including
approximately $315 million for expansion of the Company's Retail segment, and
approximately $535 million is projected to support normal replacement of
existing capital assets, enhancements to general information technology
infrastructure, and to be used for real estate acquisitions including purchases
related to the Company's second corporate campus.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
The Company has
not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the
Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative
instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to
material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation
under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.
Lease Commitments
As of September
30, 2006, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable
operating leases of approximately $1.2 billion, $887 million of which related
to leases of retail space and related facilities. The major facility leases are
for terms of 5 to 15 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3
to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years,
the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal
options. Total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases
related to the lease of retail space increased to $1.0 billion as of June 30,
2007.
Purchase Commitments with
Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers
The Company
utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the
Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products.
These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on
demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods
ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for
its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with
industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of
purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted
component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150
days. As of June 30, 2007, the Company had outstanding third-party
manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately
$2.7 billion.
During the first
quarter of 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with
Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash
memory through calendar year 2010. As
part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory
components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases
made over the life of each respective agreement. Approximately $142 million of
the prepayment had been utilized by the Company as of June 30, 2007.
28 
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company's
asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property
subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of
June 30, 2007, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of
approximately $23 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.
Other
Obligations
Other outstanding
obligations were approximately $19 million as of June 30, 2007, primarily
related to Internet and telecommunications services.
Indemnifications
The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software infringes
third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the
Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company
could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not
been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an
infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and,
in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved
infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk
The Company's
market risk profile has not changed significantly during the first nine months
of 2007.
Interest Rate and Foreign
Currency Risk Management
The Company
regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a
stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency
and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of
the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the
exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion
of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or
interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of
gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any
given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to
the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the
Company's operating results and financial position.
Interest Rate Risk
While the Company
is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading
industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most
sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this
regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the
Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as
costs associated with foreign currency hedges.
The Company's
short-term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of
capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the
current credit and interest rate environment. A portion of the Company's cash is managed by
external managers within the guidelines of the Company's investment policy and
to an objective market benchmark. The
Company's internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager
performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs.
The Company's
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the
Company's investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments
in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by
policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's
general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of
invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid
investments with initial maturities of three months or less are classified as
cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater
than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of June 30, 2007, approximately $2.1
billion of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities
ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder
all had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to
their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit
deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material
net gains or losses during the third quarter of 2007 or 2006 related to such
sales.
29 
Foreign Currency Risk
In general, the
Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of
the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross
margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company
will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures
when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company may
enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial
institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted
future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the
Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign
exchange transaction exposures in the future. However, the Company may choose
not to hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to
immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures,
and/or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation
under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (Exchange Act) were effective as of June 30, 2007 to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting
There were no
changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the
third quarter of 2007, which were identified in connection with management's
evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
The
Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims as of June 30, 2007,
the end of the quarterly period covered by this report, that are discussed
below. The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings and
claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which have not
been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have
a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that
would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results
of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company
fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal
matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the
operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially
adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during the third
quarter of 2007 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material
impact on the Company's results of operations.
Apple
Computer, Inc. v. Burst.com, Inc.
The
Company filed an action for declaratory judgment against defendant Burst.com,
Inc. on January 4, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California. The Company seeks declaratory judgment that U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,963,995, 5,164,839, 5,057,932 and 5,995,705 (Burst patents) are
invalid and not infringed by the Company. Burst filed an answer and
counterclaim on April 17, 2006. Burst alleges that the following Apple products
and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 4,963,995, 5,057,932, 5,164,839, and
5,995,705; iTunes Store, iPod devices, QuickTime products (including QuickTime
player and QuickTime Streaming Server), iTunes software, other Apple software
products (Final Cut Studio, GarageBand, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb), the use of the
.Mac services and Apple computers and servers running iTunes, QuickTime, or the
other named Apple software products. The Burst patents allegedly relate to
methods and devices used for burst transmission of audio or video files. The
case is in discovery. A claim construction hearing was held on February 8,
2007, and the court issued its claim construction ruling on May 8, 2007. Trial
is set for February 26, 2008.

Bader
v. Anderson, et al.
Plaintiff
filed this purported shareholder derivative action against the Company and each
of its then current executive officers and members of its Board of Directors on
May 19, 2005 in Santa Clara County Superior Court asserting claims for breach
of fiduciary duty, material misstatements and omissions and violations of
California Business  Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition).
Plaintiff alleges that the Company's March 14, 2005, proxy statement was false
and misleading for failure to disclose certain information relating to the
Apple Computer, Inc. Performance Bonus Plan, which was approved by shareholders
at the annual meeting held on April 21, 2005. Plaintiff, who ostensibly brings
suit on the Company's behalf, has made no demand on the Board of Directors and
alleges that such demand is excused. Plaintiff seeks injunctive and other
relief for purported injury to the Company. On July 27, 2005, plaintiff filed
an amended complaint alleging that, in addition to the purported derivative
claims, adoption of the bonus plan and distribution of the proxy statement
describing that plan also inflicted injury on her directly as an individual
shareholder. On January 10, 2006, the Court sustained defendants' demurrer to
the amended complaint, with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint on February 7, 2006, and the Company filed a demurrer. After a
hearing on June 13, 2006, the Court sustained the demurrer without leave to
amend as to the non-director officers and with leave to amend as to the
directors. On July 24, 2006, plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, which
purports to bring claims derivatively as well as directly on behalf of a class
of common stockholders who have been or will be harmed by virtue of the
allegedly misleading proxy statement. In addition to reasserting prior causes
of action, the third amended complaint included a claim that the Company
violated the terms of the plan, and a claim for waste related to restricted
stock unit grants to certain officers in 2003 and 2004 and an option grant to
the Company's CEO in January 2000. The Company filed a demurrer to the third
amended complaint. On January 30, 2007, the Court sustained the Company's
demurrer with leave to amend. Plaintiff
filed a fourth amended complaint on May 8, 2007, and the Company filed a
demurrer, which will be heard on September 28, 2007.
Birdsong
v. Apple Computer, Inc.
This
action alleges that the Company's iPod music players, and the ear bud
headphones sold with them, are inherently defective in design and are sold
without adequate warnings concerning the risk of noise-induced hearing loss by
iPod users. The Birdsong action was initially filed on January 30, 2006 in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana asserting
Louisiana causes of action on behalf of a purported Louisiana class of iPod
purchasers. A similar action (Patterson v. Apple
Computer, Inc.) was filed on January 31, 2006 in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California asserting California
causes of action on behalf of a purported class of all iPod purchasers within
the four-year period before January 31, 2006. The Birdsong action was
transferred to the Northern District of California, and the Patterson action
was dismissed. An amended complaint was subsequently filed in Birdsong,
dropping the Louisiana law-based claims and adding California law-based claims
equivalent to those in Patterson. After the Company filed a motion to dismiss
on November 3, 2006, plaintiffs agreed not to oppose the motion and filed a
second amended complaint on January 16, 2007. That complaint alleges California
law-based claims for breaches of implied and express warranties, violations of
California Business  Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition),
California Business  Professions Code 17500 (false advertising), the
Consumer Legal Remedies Act and negligent misrepresentation on behalf of a
putative nationwide class and a Louisiana law-based claim for redhibition for a
Louisiana sub-class. On March 1, 2007, the Company filed a motion to
dismiss the California law based claims.
The court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on June 4, 2007 but
has not yet issued a ruling.
A
similar complaint, Royer-Brennan v. Apple Computer, Inc. and
Apple Canada, Inc., was filed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on
February 1, 2006, seeking authorization to institute a class action on behalf
of iPod purchasers in Quebec. At the
request of plaintiffs' counsel, the court has postponed class certification
proceedings in this action indefinitely.
Branning
et al. v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiffs
originally filed this purported class action in San Francisco County Superior
Court on February 17, 2005. The initial complaint alleged violations of
California Business  Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition) and
violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) regarding a variety of
purportedly unfair and unlawful conduct including, but not limited to,
allegedly selling used computers as new and failing to honor warranties.
Plaintiffs also brought causes of action for misappropriation of trade secrets,
breach of contract and violation of the 
31 
Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act. Plaintiffs requested unspecified damages and other
relief. On May 9, 2005, the Court granted the Company's motion to transfer the
case to Santa Clara County Superior Court. On May 2, 2005, plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint adding two new named plaintiffs and three new causes of
action including a claim for treble damages under the Cartwright Act
(California Business  Professions Code 16700 et seq.) and a claim for
false advertising. The Company filed a demurrer to the amended complaint, which
the Court sustained in its entirety on November 10, 2005. The Court granted
plaintiffs leave to amend and they filed an amended complaint on December 29,
2005. Plaintiffs' amended complaint added three plaintiffs and alleged many of
the same factual claims as the previous complaints, such as alleged selling of
used equipment as new, alleged failure to honor warranties and service contracts
for the consumer plaintiffs, and alleged fraud related to the opening of the
Apple retail stores. Plaintiffs continued to assert causes of action for
unfair competition (17200), violations of the CLRA, breach of contract,
misappropriation of trade secrets, violations of the Cartwright Act, and
alleged new causes of action for fraud, conversion, and breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Company filed a demurrer to the
amended complaint on January 31, 2006, which the Court sustained on March 3,
2006 on sixteen of seventeen causes of action. Plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint adding one new plaintiff. The Company filed a demurrer, which was
granted in part on September 9, 2006. Plaintiffs filed a further amended
complaint on September 21, 2006. On October 2, 2006, the Company filed an
answer denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The
case is in discovery.
European
Commission Investigation
The
European Commission is investigating certain matters relating to the iTunes
Stores in Europe. The European Commission had previously notified the Company
that it was investigating claims made by Which?, a United Kingdom (U.K.)
consumer association, that the Company is violating EU competition law by
charging more for online music in the U.K. than in Eurozone countries and
preventing U.K. consumers from purchasing online music from the iTunes Store
for Eurozone countries. The Which? claims were originally lodged with the U.K.
Office of Fair Trading, which subsequently referred them to the European
Commission.
On
March 30, 2007, the European Commission issued Statements of Objections to the
major record labels, Apple Inc. and iTunes S..r.l. In the Statements of
Objections, the Commission challenges provisions in the agreements pursuant to
which each major record company authorizes iTunes S..r.l. to distribute
digital music downloads through the iTunes Store. The Commission contends that,
because of these provisions, residents of the European Economic Area are only
permitted to buy music from the iTunes Store for the country that issued the
customer's credit card. The Commission contends that these provisions are
territorial sales restrictions which violate Article 81 of the European
Community Treaty. The Commission seeks fines and behavioral relief. The Company filed its responses to the
Statements of Objections on June 20, 2007.
Gordon
v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff
filed this purported class action on August 31, 2006 in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division, on
behalf of a purported nationwide class of consumers who purchased 65W Power
Adapters for iBooks and Powerbooks between November 2002 and the present. The
complaint alleges various problems with the 65W Adapter, including fraying,
sparking, and premature failure. Plaintiffs allege violations of California
Business  Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition), the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and breach of warranties.
The complaint seeks damages and equitable relief. The Company filed an answer
on October 20, 2006 denying the material allegations and asserting numerous
affirmative defenses. A mediation was held on March 13, 2007. The litigation
has been suspended pending ongoing settlement discussions.
Greaves
v. Apple Computer, Inc.
On
June 30, 2006, plaintiff filed this purported class action in San Diego

discoloration of the MacBook case. Plaintiff asserts claims under California
Business  Professions Code 17500 (false advertising), California Business
Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition), the Consumer Legal Remedies
Act and misrepresentation. Plaintiff's complaint seeks damages and equitable
relief. Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on August 16, 2006. The
Company filed an answer on October 3, 2006 denying all allegations and
asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The parties have reached a settlement

7, 2005 adding additional defendants and expanding the scope of the accused products.
Given the stay, the Company's response to the amended complaint is not yet due.

special committee of the Company's outside directors had retained independent
counsel to perform an investigation and that the Company had informed the

manufactured or designed using processes necessary to ensure normal resistance
to scratching of the screen; and (2) all iPod nano purchasers other than U.S.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Because
of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's
operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should
not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in
future periods.
The matters relating to the
investigation by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors and the
restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements may result in
additional litigation and governmental enforcement actions.
On
June 29, 2006, the Company announced that an internal review had discovered
irregularities related to certain stock option grants made between 1997 and
2001, including a grant to its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Steve
Jobs. The Company also announced that a
Special Committee of outside directors (Special Committee) had been formed
and had hired independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the
Company's past stock option granting practices. As a result of the
internal review and independent investigation, management concluded, and the
Audit and Finance Committee agreed, that incorrect measurement dates had been
used for financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made
before 2003. Accordingly, the Company recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation
expense, and related tax effects, with regard to certain past stock option
grants, and the Company restated certain previously filed financial statements
included in the 2006 Form 10-K.
The
Company's past stock option granting practices and the restatement of prior
financial statements have exposed the Company to greater risks associated with
litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. As
described in Part II, Item 1., Legal Proceedings, several derivative
complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in state and federal
courts against the Company and certain current and former directors and
executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to past stock option
grants. The Company has provided the results of its internal review and
independent investigation to the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office
for the Northern District of California, and in that regard the Company has
responded to informal requests for documents and additional information. The
Company intends to continue full cooperation.
38 
On April 24, 2007, the SEC filed an enforcement action against two
former officers of the Company. In announcing the lawsuit, the SEC stated that
it would not bring an enforcement action against the Company based in part on the Company's swift,
extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission's investigation.
According to the SEC's statement, the Company's cooperation consisted of,
among other things, prompt self-reporting, an independent internal
investigation, the sharing of the results of that investigation with the
government, and the implementation of new controls designed to prevent the
recurrence of fraudulent conduct.
No
assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from litigation, regulatory
proceedings or government enforcement actions relating to the Company's past
stock option practices. These and related matters have required, and will
continue to require, the Company to incur substantial expenses for legal,
accounting, tax and other professional services, and may divert management's
attention from the Company's business. If the Company is subject to adverse
findings in litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement
actions, the Company could be required to pay damages and penalties and might
face additional remedies that could harm its business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.
Unfavorable results of legal
proceedings could adversely affect the Company's results of operations.
The Company is subject
to various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed in Part II, Item 1.,
Legal Proceedings, of this Form 10-Q. The Company is also subject to certain
other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of
business and which have not been fully adjudicated. Results of legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty.
In addition, regardless of its merit, litigation may be disruptive to
the Company's normal business operations, time-consuming, result in significant
expenses, and cause the diversion of management attention. Should the Company
fail to prevail in certain legal matters, or should several of these legal
matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the
Company's financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be
materially adversely affected.
Economic
conditions and political events could adversely affect the demand for the
Company's products and the
financial health of its suppliers, distributors,
and resellers.
The Company's operating performance depends significantly on economic
conditions in the U.S. and abroad. At times in the past, demand for the Company's
products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions.
Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast
future demand for the Company's products and related operating results. Should
global and/or regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Company's
products could be materially adversely affected, as could the financial health
of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.
War, terrorism, public health
issues, natural disasters and other circumstances could disrupt supply,
delivery, or demand of products, which could negatively affect the Company's operations
and performance.
War, terrorism,
geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business
interruptions, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could cause
damage or disruption to international commerce
and the global economy, and thus may have a strong negative impact on the
global economy, the Company, and the Company's suppliers, logistics
providers or customers. The Company's major business operations are subject to
interruption by earthquake, other natural disasters, fire, power shortages,
terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues,
and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Company's research and
development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems,
and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers
and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the
Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses and
significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, the Company's
operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man-made
disaster.
Although it is
impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events
including when the Company could resume operations, such events could result in
a decrease in demand for the Company's products, make it difficult or
impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers or to
receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in
the Company's supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues,
including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively affected by more
stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the
availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of
products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products,
and disruptions in the operations of the Company's manufacturing vendors and
component suppliers. The Company's operating results and financial condition
have been, and in the future may be, materially adversely affected by such
events.
39
The global market for personal
computers and related peripherals and services, digital music devices and
related services, and mobile phones, is highly competitive. If the Company is
unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could
be adversely affected.
The global
personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by
aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent
introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry
standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics,
rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price
sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Price
competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has
been particularly intense as competitors who sell Windows and Linux based
personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product
margins for personal computing products. The Company's results of operations
and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be,
materially adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing
pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.
The global
personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological
advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on
existing or emerging industry standards.
Further, as the global personal computer industry and its customers place
more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that
include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional
personal computers, may compete for market share with the Company's existing
products. Several competitors of the Company have targeted certain of the
Company's key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and
consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the
Company's competitors have introduced digital music and video products and/or
online stores offering digital music and video distribution that mimic many of
the unique hardware and software designs, technical features, and solutions of
the Company's products. The Company has a significant number of competitors,
many of whom have broader product lines and larger installed customer bases
than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards
consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and
potentially stronger competitors in the Company's markets.
The Company is
currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a
minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by
makers of computers utilizing competing operating systems, including Windows
and Linux. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are
substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to
the Macintosh platform to maintain perceived design and functional advantages
over competing platforms. Additionally, if unauthorized copies of the
Mac OS are used on other companies' hardware products and result in decreased
demand for the Company's hardware products, the Company's results of operations
may be materially adversely affected.
The Company is
currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music and video
distribution and related consumer electronic devices, including iPods and
iPhones. The Company faces significant competition from other companies
promoting their own music and video products including digital players, music
enabled cell phones, CDs, DVDs, peer-to-peer music and video services, and
streaming of digital content via the Internet. These competitors include both
new entrants with different market approaches, such as content subscription
services models, and also larger companies that may have significant technical,
marketing, distribution, and other resources, as well as established hardware,
software, and digital content supplier relationships. The Company is also
competing with illegitimate ways to obtain digital content. Failure to
effectively compete could negatively affect the Company's operating results and
financial position. The Company expects
competition in this space to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the
Company's approach to seamlessly providing these components within their
individual offerings or work more collaboratively with each other to offer
solutions that are more integrated than those they offer currently. Some of these
current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to
provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to
compete with the Company's offerings.
There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to
provide products and services that effectively compete in these areas. The Company may also have to respond to price
competition by lowering prices and/or increasing features which could
materially adversely affect the Company's music product gross margins as well
as overall Company gross margins.
With the
introduction of iPhone in June 2007, the Company has begun to compete with
mobile communication device companies. This is a highly competitive industry
with several large, well funded, and experienced competitors, and the Company
may not be able to compete successfully.
This industry has aggressive pricing practices, frequent product
introductions, evolving technologies, rapid adoption of technological and
product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of
consumers, and a large number of competitors with substantial experience and
technological and financial resources. The Company's operating results and
financial condition may be materially adversely affected should it be unable to
effectively compete in this industry.
40 
The Company also
faces significant competition in the U.S. education market. U.S. elementary and
secondary schools, as well as college and university customers, remain a core
market for the Company. Although the Company believes it has taken certain
steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of
the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements.
Failure to do so may have a material adverse impact on the Company's operating
results and financial condition.
Future operating results are
dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain key components at favorable
prices and in sufficient quantities, including microprocessors and NAND flash
memory.
Certain key
components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain
LCDs, certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited
sources which subjects the Company to supply and pricing risks. Many of these
and other key components that are available from multiple sources including,
but not limited to, NAND flash memory, DRAM memory, and certain LCDs, are at
times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing
fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for
the supply of critical components at favorable pricing, and there is no
guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements
when they expire. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks
of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect
gross margins and operating margins. Indeed, the Company expects to experience
decreases in its gross margin percentage as compared to current levels due in
part to current and expected future price increases for certain
components. See Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Gross
Margin.
In addition to the
impact of general market conditions for components, new products introduced by
the Company often utilize custom components obtained from only one source until
the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently
qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product
utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such
time as the suppliers' yields have matured. The Company and other producers in
the personal computer and consumer electronics industries also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand
for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the
rest of the personal computer or consumer electronics industries. Continued
availability of these components at acceptable prices may be affected if
producers decide to concentrate on the production of components other than
those customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key
component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if such
components were available only at significantly higher prices, the Company's
results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.
The Company currently relies
exclusively on a single service provider in the U.S. for iPhone.
ATT Mobility LLC (ATT Mobility) is the Company's exclusive
U.S. cellular network provider for iPhone. If ATT Mobility cannot
successfully compete with other wireless carriers in areas such as quality and
coverage of wireless voice and data services, performance and timely build-out
of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and terms of end user contracts, or
if for any reason ATT Mobility customers experience service interruptions,
future sales of iPhone may be materially adversely impacted.
The Company must successfully
manage frequent product introductions and transitions to remain competitive and
effectively stimulate customer demand.
Due to the highly
volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer
electronics industries, which are characterized by dynamic customer demand
patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce
new products and technologies, enhance existing products to remain competitive,
and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded
versions of the Company's existing products. The success of new product
introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including timely and
successful completion of development efforts; market acceptance; the Company's
ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp
issues; the availability of application software for new products; the
effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with
anticipated product demand; the availability of products in appropriate
quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new
products, including iPhone, may have quality or other defects in the early
stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance
the ultimate effect new products will have on its sales or results of
operations.
41 
During calendar
year 2006, the Company transitioned its Macintosh line of computers from the
PowerPC to Intel microprocessors. This
transition has been and will continue to be subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties including the timely innovation and delivery of related software
products to support Intel microprocessors and the development and availability
on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company
to timely deliver Intel-based Macintosh computers. In addition, the
Company is dependent on third-party software developers such as Microsoft and
Adobe to timely develop current and future applications that run on Intel-based
Macintosh computers. Microsoft Office is
not currently available in a Universal version that can run natively on both
Intel and Power-PC-based Macintosh computers.
Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
maintain its historical gross margin percentages on its products, including
Intel-based Macintosh computers, which may materially adversely impact the Company's
results of operations.
Telecommunication
devices, such as iPhone, are subject to certification and regulation by
governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by wireless carriers for
use on their networks. These
certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in
additional testing requirements or changes to such devices. Any such slowdown in the certification
process may delay ship dates, which may materially adversely affect the Company's
results of operations.
The Company's products from time
to time experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and
operating profits.
The Company sells
highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in
design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and
applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can
unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also
occur in components and products the Company purchases from third-parties.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all
defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could result in
lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to
remedy.
Because orders for components,
and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance
of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.
The Company
records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have
become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value
and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees for orders of products and
components that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its
inventory and related provisions are currently adequate, given the rapid and
unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal computer,
consumer electronics and mobile communication device industries, no assurance
can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related
charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on
the Company's financial position and results of operations.
The Company must
order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product
announcements and shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile,
competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk
the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties
excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components.
Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a
combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on
projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the
Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods
ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company's operating results and financial
condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected
by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term
shifts in customer demand patterns.
The Company is dependent on
component and product manufacturing and logistics services provided by third
parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S.
Most of the
Company's components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by
third-party manufacturers, many of which are located outside of the U.S. A
significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently
performed by only a few third-party manufacturers, often in single locations. In
addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics
management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations,
they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution.
It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or
quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered, 
42 
or the flexibility
of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. In addition, the
Company is reliant on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the Company's
supplier code of conduct. Moreover,
although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for
warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the
consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty
liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or
otherwise, could materially adversely affect the Company's reputation and
future operating results and financial condition.
Final assembly of
products sold by the Company is currently performed in the Company's
manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont,
California; Fullerton, California; the Republic of Korea; the People's Republic
of China; and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacturing of many of the
components used in the Company's products is performed by third-party vendors
in the U.S., China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Final assembly of substantially all of the
Company's portable products, including MacBook Pros, MacBooks, iPods and
iPhones is performed by third-party vendors in China. If for any reason
manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional
economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues,
or due to information technology system failures or military actions, the
Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.
The Company's future operating
performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers
of the Company's products.
The Company
distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional
retailers, value added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute
products from competing manufacturers. The Company distributes iPhone in the U.S. through its
online and retail stores as well as through ATT Mobility's retail stores.
In addition, the Company sells many of its products and resells certain
third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end-users,
certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores
around the world and its retail stores. Many of the Company's resellers operate
on narrow product margins and have been negatively impacted in the past by weak
economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by
collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution
and retail channel partners. The Company's business and financial results could
be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers
weakens, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of
the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's
products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's
products. The Company has invested and
will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales,
including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company employees and
contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial
investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or
incremental revenue to offset this investment.
Over the past
several years, an increasing proportion of the Company's net sales have been
made by the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the
world and through its retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K., and
Italy. Additionally, the Company has announced its plans to open stores in
other European and Asian countries and is exploring additional international
store locations. Some of the Company's resellers have perceived this expansion
of the Company's direct sales as conflicting with their own businesses and
economic interests as distributors and resellers of the Company's products.
Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Company's resellers from
investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Company's
products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Company's products.
The Company's business and financial results could be materially adversely
affected if expansion of its direct sales to end-users causes some or all of
its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Company's products.
The Company relies on third-party
digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.
The Company
contracts with third parties to offer their digital content to customers
through the Company's iTunes Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain
the rights to offer to its customers this third-party digital content. The
Company's licensing arrangements with these third-party content providers are
short-term in nature and do not guarantee the continuation or future renewal of
these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have
consolidated and formed alliances, which could limit the availability and
increase the fees required to offer digital content to customers through the
iTunes Store. Some third-party content providers currently or may in the future
offer music products and services that compete with the Company's music
products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or
impossible for the Company to license their digital content in the future. Further, other distributors of third-party
content or third-party content owners may seek 
43 
to limit the
Company's access to or increase the total cost of such content. If the Company is unable to continue to offer
a wide variety of digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage
rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, then sales and gross margins
of the Company's iTunes Store, as well as related hardware and peripherals,
including iPods, iPhone and Apple TV, may be materially adversely affected.
Many third-party
content providers, artists, and studios require that the Company provide
certain digital rights management (DRM) solutions and other security
mechanisms. If the requirements from
content providers, artists, or studios change, then the Company may be required
to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and
requirements. In addition, certain
countries have passed legislation or may propose legislation that would force
the Company to license its DRM, which could lessen the protection of content
and subject it to piracy and could also affect arrangements with the Company's
content suppliers. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or
license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all,
which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's operating results
and financial position.
The Company's future performance
is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If
third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the
Company's hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Company's
products.
The Company
believes decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers,
as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability
of third-party application software such as Microsoft Office. The Company
also believes the availability of third-party application, gaming, and
other software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party
developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing,
maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus
software for the larger Windows market or growing Linux market. This analysis
may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its
products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, continued
acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software
products. To the extent the minority market share held by the Company in the
global personal computer market has caused software developers to question the
Company's prospects in the global personal computer market, developers could be
less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software
for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to
developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market or growing
Linux market. The Company's announcement that it plans to add a feature to the
next version of Mac OS X that will enable Intel-based Macintosh systems to run
Windows XP may deter developers from creating software applications for Mac OS
X if such applications are available for the Windows platform. Moreover, there can be no assurance software
developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X on a timely basis or
at all.
During calendar
year 2006, the Company transitioned its Macintosh line of computers from the
PowerPC to Intel microprocessors. The
Company depends on third-party software developers to timely develop current
and future Universal applications. A Universal version of Microsoft Office and
certain other important applications are currently not available. The lack of
Universal applications that run on Intel-based Macintosh systems could have a
materially adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial
position.
In addition, past
and future development by the Company of its own software applications and
solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers, such as
Microsoft and Adobe, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive
software for the Company's products. The Company currently markets and sells a
variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, creative,
and education customers that could influence the decisions of third-party
software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software
products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include
software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and
visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music
production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding
and authoring, professional digital photo editing and workflow management,
consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music
management, desktop-based database management, word processing, and
high-quality presentations. Discontinuance of third-party software products for
the Macintosh platform could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's
net sales and results of operations.
44 
The Company's business relies on
access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and
the Company's future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or
found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
Many of the
Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from
third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew
licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the
Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such
licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However,
there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or
available on acceptable terms.
Because of
technological changes in the global personal computer and consumer electronics
industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance
of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and
business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The
Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain
patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such
claims, regardless of their merit, can be time-consuming, result in significant
expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel.
Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may
consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of
these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be
obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event
there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company
from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of
infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a
third-party, the Company's future operating results and financial condition
could be materially adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims
and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and
other matters is set forth in Part II, Item 1., Legal Proceedings, of this
Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management,
the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from
any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of
patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually
or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot
be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the
matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights
of others described in Part II, Item 1., Legal Proceedings, of this Form 10-Q
or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same
reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could
be materially adversely affected.
Additionally, with the June 2007 introduction of iPhone, the Company
has begun to compete with mobile communication device companies who hold
significant patent portfolios. Regardless of the scope or validity of any
such patents orthe merits of anypotential patent claims by
competitors, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter
into expensive agreements or settlements and/ormodify its products in
response to these patents, which may be time-consuming and divert management
and technical personnel attention. Any of
these events could materially adversely impact the Company's results of
operations and financial condition.
The Company's
retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial
investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties.
Through June 30, 2007, the Company had opened 185 retail stores. The
Company's retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment
and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The
Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for
retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which
are for 10 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to
terminate these commitments or close individual stores. Such costs could
materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial
condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segment's
costs are fixed because of personnel costs, depreciation of store construction
costs, and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should
the Retail segment experience a significant decline in sales for any reason.
Certain of the Company's stores have been designed and built to serve
as high-profile venues that function as vehicles for certain corporate
sales and marketing activities, corporate briefings, and to promote brand
awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these
stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Company's more typical
retail stores. The Company has opened eight such stores through June 30, 2007.
Because of their location and size, these high-profile stores also require the
Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared
to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations
have terms ranging from 10 to 16 years with total remaining commitments per
location ranging from $3 million to $31 million. Closure or poor performance of
any of these high-profile stores could have a significant negative impact on
the Company's results of operations and financial condition.
45 
Many of the
general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have a material
adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail
operations, some of which are beyond
the Company's control, present risks and
uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the Retail segment's
future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently
expected, and/or have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations and financial condition. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to
retail operations that could have a material adverse impact on the Retail
segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a
negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs
associated with store construction and operation; inability to sell third-party
hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage
relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in
managing retail operations outside the U.S.; costs associated with
unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail
inventory; and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations
at a reasonable cost.
Investment in new business
strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company's ongoing business and may
present risks not originally contemplated.
The Company has
and may in the future invest in new business strategies or engage in
acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties,
including distraction of management's attention away from current business
operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and
expenses associated with the strategy; inadequate return of capital; and
unidentified issues not discovered in the Company's due diligence process.
Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that
such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially
adversely affect the Company's business, operating results or financial
condition.
Declines in the sales of the
Company's professional products, software, accessories, or service and support
contracts, or increases in sales of consumer products, including iPods, may
negatively impact the Company's gross margin and operating margin percentages.
The Company's
professional products, including MacBook Pro and Mac Pro systems, software,
accessories, and service and support contracts, generally have higher gross
margins than the Company's consumer products, including the iMac, Mac mini,
MacBook, iPod, iPhone and content from the iTunes Store. A shift in sales mix
away from higher margin products and services towards lower margin products and
services could materially adversely affect the Company's future gross margin
and operating margin percentages. The Company's traditional professional
customers may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac and
MacBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy
the iMac due to its relative price performance and unique design featuring a
flat panel screen. Professional users may also choose to purchase MacBooks
instead of the Company's professional-oriented portable products due to their
price performance and screen size. Additionally, significant future growth in
iPod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could
also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages.
The Company expects its quarterly
revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.
The Company's
profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The
Company's direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores,
generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through
its channel partners. In addition the Company's gross margin and operating
margin percentages, as well as overall profitability may be materially
adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel
mix, or new product announcements. The Company generally sells more product
during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first
two months, a pattern typical in the global personal computer and consumer
electronics industries. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's
internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely
impact the Company's ability to predict its financial results accurately.
Furthermore, the Company has typically experienced greater net sales in the
first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in the fiscal year
due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the
school year. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated
demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of
one of the Company's key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing
partners, could have material adverse impacts on the Company and its results of
operations and financial condition.
The Company has higher research
and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage
of revenue, than many of its competitors.
The Company's
ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins,
operating margins, and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to
ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and
technologies to the marketplace. The Company is generally unique in that it
designs and develops the entire solution for its personal computers and
consumer electronics products, including the hardware, operating system,
several software applications, and related services. As a result of this
investment and the Company's size, the Company generally incurs higher research
and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors. Many of
these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low
cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Company's Retail
segment and costs associated with marketing the Company's brand including its
unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a
percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to
continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross and
operating margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely
affected by its operating cost structure.
46 
The Company is exposed to credit
risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply
agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions
worsen.
The Company
distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers
and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A
substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not
covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured
non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from
the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing
vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the
Company. In addition, the Company has entered into long-term supply agreements
to secure supply of NAND flash-memory and has prepaid a total of $1.25 billion
under these agreements. While the
Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on
its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can
be no assurance such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk
and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy or regional economies
deteriorate, the Company would be more likely to incur a material loss or
losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its
customers or manufacturing vendors.
The Company's success depends
largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.
Much of the future
success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of
skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its
executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions.
Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and
competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley,
where the majority of the Company's key employees are located. The Company has
relied on its ability to grant equity awards as one mechanism for recruiting
and retaining this highly skilled talent. Recent accounting regulations
requiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stock-based
compensation expense, which has caused the Company to reduce the number of
stock-based awards issued to employees. There can be no assurance that the
Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel.
The Company is subject to risks
associated with the availability and coverage of insurance.
For certain risks,
the Company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or
availability. Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable
risks, and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic
losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and financial position.
Failure of information technology
systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the Company relies
could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.
Information technology
system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company's
ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing
delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment
of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or
Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns for
its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal
control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or
data security breach of the Company or a third-party vendor will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.
The Company's business is subject
to the risks of international operations.
A large portion of
the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a
result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be
significantly affected by risks associated with international activities,
including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws
(including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the
U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods
and services are purchased. The Company's primary exposure to movements in
foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in
Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar
denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in
foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact
consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the
Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening in
these and other foreign currencies can cause the Company to modify
international pricing and affect the value of the Company's foreign denominated
sales, and in some cases, may also increase the cost to the Company of some
product components.
47 
Margins on sales
of the Company's products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that
include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be materially adversely
affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international
trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.
Derivative
instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been
utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. The use of such hedging
activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact
resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
Further
information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part
II, Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of
the 2006 Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2006 under the subheading Foreign
Currency Risk and may be found in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, of the 2006 Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company is subject to risks
associated with environmental regulations.
Production and
marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company
to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various
European Union member countries, Japan, and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations
and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future
laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
condition, liquidity, or results of operations.
Changes in accounting rules could
affect the Company's future operating results.
Financial
statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing
bodies, including the FASB and the SEC, who create and interpret appropriate
accounting standards. A change from current accounting standards could have a
significant effect on the Company's results of operations.
In December 2004,
the FASB issued new guidance that addresses the accounting for share-based
payments, SFAS No. 123R, which the Company adopted in 2006. Although the
adoption of SFAS No. 123R has had and is expected to continue to have a
significant impact on the Company's results of operations, future changes to
various assumptions used to determine the fair-value of awards issued or the
amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of
future stock-based compensation expense.
Changes in the Company's tax
rates could affect its future results.
The Company's
future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by
changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,
changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities,
or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the
continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue
Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine
the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance the
outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.
The Company's stock price may be
volatile.
The Company's
stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of
variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result
of announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has, at
times, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the
market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated
to the operating performance of these companies. Furthermore, the Company
believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability
expectations. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price
may significantly decline. In addition, increases in the Company's stock price
may result in greater dilution of earnings per share.
For additional discussion
of these and other factors affecting the Company's future results and financial
condition, see Item 1., Business in the Company's 2006 Form 10-K.
