GOOGLE INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Unaudited)  Note 1. Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Nature of Operations  We were incorporated in California in September 1998. We were re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in
August 2003. We provide highly targeted advertising and global internet search solutions as well as intranet solutions via an enterprise search appliance.  Basis of Consolidation  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Google and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Unaudited Interim Financial Information  The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March31, 2009, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March31, 2008 and
2009, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March31, 2008 and 2009 are unaudited. These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. In our opinion, the unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of March31, 2009, our results
of operations for the three months ended March31, 2008 and 2009, and our cash flows for the three months ended March31, 2008 and 2009. The results of operations for the three months ended March31, 2009 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December31, 2009.  These unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February13, 2009.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of interim
Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, fair values
of prepaid revenue share, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of options to purchase our common stock, and income taxes, among others. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In
April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No.FAS141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies, which
amends and clarifies the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and related disclosures of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No.141 (revised 2007),Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). This FSP is effective for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after
December15, 2008. We adopted this FSP in the first quarter of 2009 and the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements largely depends on the size and nature of the business combinations.  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly
Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly, which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). This FSP states that a significant
decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability when compared with normal market activity is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be determinative of fair value because there may be increased instances of
transactions that are not orderly in 
6 
Table of Contents
such market conditions. Accordingly, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may
be necessary to estimate fair value. This FSP is effective for us beginning April1, 2009. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this FSP to be material on our consolidated financial statements.  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, which requires disclosures
about the fair value of our financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value, whether recognized or not recognized in the balance sheets, in the interim reporting periods as well as in the annual reporting periods. In
addition, the FSP requires disclosures of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of those financial instruments. This FSP is effective for us beginning April1, 2009. We do not expect the impact of the adoption
of this FSP to be material on our consolidated financial statements.  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition
and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments, which establishes a new method of recognizing and reporting other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities and requires additional disclosures related to debt and equity securities. This
FSP does not change existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. This FSP is effective for us beginning April1, 2009. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this FSP to
be material on our consolidated financial statements.  Note 2. Net Income Per Share of ClassA and Class B Common Stock  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of ClassA and Class B common stock (in thousands, except per share
amounts):

Table of Contents
The net income per share amounts are the same for ClassA and Class B because the holders of each class are
legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.  Note 3. Cash and Investments  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of the following (in thousands):  
The following table summarizes unrealized gains and losses related to our investments in marketable
securities designated as available-for-sale (in thousands):  
8 
Table of Contents
Time deposits were held by institutions outside the U.S. at December31, 2008 and March31, 2009.
Gross unrealized gains and losses on cash equivalents were not material at December31, 2008 and March31, 2009.  Our corporate debt
securities are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States government under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) or the sovereign guarantee of foreign governments under
similar programs to the TLGP.  Our agency residential mortgage-backed securities are specified pools of mortgage pass-through securities that are
guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises. Our commercial mortgage-backed securities are fully defeased securities with underlying collateral loans replacedby U.S. Treasury notes.  We recognized gross realized gains of $50.8 million and $34.3 million on the sale of our marketable securities for the three months ended March31, 2008 and
2009. Gross realized losses were not material in either period. Realized gains and losses are included in interest income and other, net, in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable securities, excluding the marketable equity security, designated as
available-for-sale classified by the contractual maturity date of the security (in thousands):  
9 
Table of Contents
In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, the following table shows gross unrealized losses and fair value for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December31, 2008 and March31, 2009,
aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in thousands):  
As of December31, 2008 and March31, 2009, we did not have any investments in marketable
securities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater.  Auction Rate Securities  At March31, 2009, we held $189.8 million of auction rate securities (ARS). The assets underlying these 35 individual investments are primarily student loans
which are mostly AAA rated and substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Historically, these securities have provided liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable
interest rate at pre-determined intervals every 7 to 49 days. However, these auctions began to fail in the first quarter of 2008. Since these auctions have failed, we have realized higher interest rates for many of these ARS than we would have
otherwise. Although we have been receiving interest payments at these generally higher rates, the related principal amounts will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuer calls
the security, or the security matures according to contractual terms. Maturity dates for these ARS investments range from 2025 to 2047. Since these auctions have failed, $47.8 million of the related securities were called at par by their issuers.
As a result of the auction failures, these ARS do not have a readily determinable market value. To estimate their fair values at March31,
2009, we used a discounted cash flow model based on estimated interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, the credit quality of the underlying securities and illiquidity considerations. Specifically, we estimated the future cash flows of our
ARS over the expected workout periods using a projected weighted average interest rate of 4.0%per annum, which is based on the forward swap curve at the end of March 2009 plus any additional basis points currently paid by the issuers assuming
these auctions continue to fail. A discount factor was applied over these estimated cash flows of our ARS, which is calculated based on the interpolated forward swap curve adjusted by up to 2,000 basis points to reflect the current market conditions
for instruments with similar credit quality at the date of the valuation and additionally adjusted for a liquidity discount of up to 400 basis points to reflect the risk in the marketplace for these investments that has arisen due to the lack of an
active market.  At March31, 2009, the estimated fair values of these ARS were $32.8 million ($19.5 million, net of tax effect) less than their
costs. Based primarily on our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery and the extent of impairment, we concluded the decline in fair values was temporary and recorded the unrealized loss to accumulated other comprehensive income
on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at March31, 2009.  
10 
Table of Contents
To the extent we determine that any impairment is other-than-temporary, we would record a charge to earnings. In
addition, we have concluded that the auctions for these securities may continue to fail for at least the next 12 months and as a result, they have been classified as non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at March31,
2009.  Note 4. Derivative Financial Instruments  We enter
into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our program is not designated for trading or speculative
purposes.  In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), we recognize derivative
instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as interest income and other,
net, as part of revenues, or to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Cash Flow Hedges
We use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. Any gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest income and other, net, if the hedged
transaction becomes probable of not occurring.  At March 31, 2009, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $338.1
million, of which $316.7 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to revenues within the next 12 months.  Any gain after a hedge is
de-designated because the hedged transaction is no longer probable of occurring or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest income and other, net, immediately. Further, the change in the time value of the options is
excluded from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The premium paid or time value of an option whose strike price is equal to or greater than the market price on the date of purchase is recorded as an asset. Thereafter, any change to this time
value is included in interest income and other, net.  The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros was
1.9 billion (or approximately $2.6 billion) and 2.1 billion (or approximately $2.8 billion) at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009; the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds was
1.1 billion (or approximately $1.8 billion) and 1.1 billion (or approximately $1.7 billion) at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009 ; and the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian
dollars was C$229.7 million (or approximately $202.2 million) and C$261.8 million (or approximately $216.7 million) at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009 . These foreign exchange options have maturities of 18 months or less. There were no other
foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.  Other Derivatives  Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133 consist of forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary
assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs are included in interest income and other, net, along with the gains and losses of the
related hedged items. Costs incurred related to these contracts during the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2009 were not material. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $2.6
billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $54.2 million and $97.4 million at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009. The
notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other currencies was 630.5 million (or approximately $897.6 million) and 476.7 million (or approximately $634.3 million) at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009. The
notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for other currencies was 4.0 million (or approximately $5.3 million) at March 31, 2009.  Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). At December 31, 2008 and March

Note 5. Fair Value Measurements  In accordance with SFAS 157, we measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, auction rate securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. SFAS 157 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the
amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level1Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
Level2Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.  Level3Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.  The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2. This is because our cash equivalents and marketable
securities are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. Our investments in ARS is classified within Level 3 because they are valued using valuation techniques (see Note 3). Some
of the inputs to these models are unobservable in the market and are significant. Our foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar
instruments.  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):

Note 10. Contingencies  Legal Matters  Companies have filed trademark infringement and related claims against us over the display of ads in response to
user queries that include trademark terms. The outcomes of these lawsuits have differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We currently have three cases pending at the European Court of Justice, which will address questions regarding whether
advertisers and search engines can be held liable for use of trademarked terms in keyword advertising. We are litigating, or have recently litigated similar issues in other cases, in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, France, Germany,
Israel, and Italy.  We have also had copyright claims filed against us alleging that features of certain of our products and services, including
Google Web Search, Google News, Google Video, Google Image Search, Google Book Search and YouTube, infringe the rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing
16 
Table of Contents
agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain functionalities, and may also result in a change in our business practices, which could result in a loss of
revenue for us or otherwise harm our business. In addition, any time one of our products or services links to or hosts material in which others allegedly own copyrights, we face the risk of being sued for copyright infringement or related claims.
Because these products and services comprise the majority of our products and services, our business could be harmed in the event of an adverse result in any of these claims.  We have also had patent lawsuits filed against us alleging that certain of our products and services, including Google Web Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense
and Google Chrome, infringe patents held by others. In addition, the number of demands for license fees and the dollar amounts associated with each request continue to increase. Adverse results in these lawsuits, or our decision to license patents
based upon these demands, may result in substantial costs and, in the case of adverse litigation results, could prevent us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or
otherwise harm our business.  We are also a party to other litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business, including
intellectual property claims (in addition to the trademark and copyright matters noted above), labor and employment claims and threatened claims, breach of contract claims, tax and other matters.  Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of the matters discussed above will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  EPA Investigation
In February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of
our smaller data facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We are cooperating with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials. The EPA investigation could result in fines, civil
or criminal penalties, or other administrative action.  While we currently believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, we have noted it in accord with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that call for disclosure of certain environmental proceedings that may result in monetary
sanctions of $100,000 or more.  Income Taxes  We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and various other tax authorities. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements
with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal
of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment,
a further charge to expense would result.  Note 11. Stockholders' Equity  The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted (excluding options granted in connection with the Exchange, see below) in the periods presented:

The following table summarizes the activities for our options for the three months ended March31, 2009:

Table of Contents
The following table summarizes additional information regarding outstanding, exercisable and exercisable and vested
stock options at March31, 2009:  
Options outstanding at March31, 2009 in the above tables include 10,153 options granted and exercised
subsequent to March21, 2002 that are unvested at March31, 2009, in accordance with EITFIssue No. 00-23, Issues Related to Accounting for Stock Compensation Under APB Opinion No.25 and FASB Interpretation No.44.
However, the computations of the weighted-average exercise prices, weighted-average remaining contractual term and aggregate intrinsic value do not consider these unvested shares. Further, the above tables include 1.7million warrants held by
financial institutions that were options purchased from employees under our Transferable Stock Option (TSO) program.  The total grant date fair value
of stock options vested during the three months ended March31, 2008 and 2009 was $161.0 million and $112.3 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options exercised during the three months ended March31, 2008 and 2009 was $228.3
million and $106.9 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our TSO program.  During the three months
ended March31, 2009, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial institutions under the TSO program was 149,239 at a total value of $18.0 million, or an average of $120.51 per share, and an average premium of $44.69 per
share. The premium is calculated as the difference between (a)the sale price of the TSO and (b)the intrinsic value of the TSO, which we define as the excess, if any, of the price of our ClassA common stock at the time of the sale
over the exercise price of the TSO. At March31, 2009, the number of options eligible for participation under the TSO program was 10.3 million.  In March 2009, we completed an offer to exchange certain employee stock options issued under Google's 2004 Stock Plan (the Exchange). Certain previously granted options were exchanged for new options with a lower exercise price granted
on a one-for-one basis. Options for an aggregate of approximately 7.6million shares of Google's ClassA common stock were exchanged. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have an exercise price of $308.57 per share, the closing
price of Google's ClassA common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March6, 2009. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have a new vesting schedule determined by adding 12 months to each vesting date under the
exchanged options' original vesting schedule. In addition, new options will vest no sooner than six months after the date of the Exchange. The Exchange resulted in a modification charge of approximately $360 million which will be recognized
over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting periods range from six months to five years. We recorded approximately $11 million of this $360 million modification charge in the three months ended March31, 2009.

As of March31, 2009, there was $1,375.6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding
employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.6 years. To the extent the forfeiture rate is different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be
different from our expectations.  The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested restricted stock units and restricted shares for the
three months ended March31, 2009:  
As of March31, 2009, there was $1,265.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to employee unvested restricted stock units and restricted shares.
This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our
expectations.  Note 12. Income Taxes  We are subject to
income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes (FIN 48) clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109), and prescribes a
recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Our total unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2008 and March31, 2009 were $721.0 million and $995.7 million. Also, our total unrecognized tax
benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $561.3 million and $673.5 million as of December31, 2008 and March31, 2009. The increase in our unrecognized tax benefits during the three months ended March31,
2009 was primarily related to uncertain tax positions relating to our international structure.  Note 13. Information about Geographic Areas  Our chief operating decision-makers (i.e., our chief executive officer, his direct reports and our presidents) review financial information presented on a
consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. There are no segment managers who are held accountable by our chief operating
decision-makers, or anyone else, for operations, operating results and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we consider ourselves to be in a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.

Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.  Overview  Google is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our web
site a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. We serve three primary constituencies:

Table of Contents
How We Generate Revenue  Advertising revenues made up 98% of our revenues for the three months ended March31, 2008 and 97% for the three months ended March31, 2009. We derive most of our additional revenues from offering internet ad serving
and management services to advertisers and ad agencies, the license of our enterprise products, search solutions and web search technology.  Google
AdWords is our automated online program that enables advertisers to place targeted text-based and display ads on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which
means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our web sites and our Google Network
members' web sites as specified by the advertiser. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-click pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results
on our web sites or next to the search results or content on our Google Network members' web sites. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time their ads are
displayed on the Google Network members' web sites. Our AdWords agreements are generally terminable at any time by our advertisers.  Google
AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers' AdWords ads for display on the web sites of our Google Network members as well as programs to deliver ads on television. Our AdSense programs include AdSense for
search and AdSense for content.  AdSense for search is our online service for distributing relevant ads from our advertisers for display with search
results on our Google Network members' sites. To use AdSense for search, most of our AdSense for search partners add Google search functionality to their web pages in the form of customizable Google search boxes. When visitors of these web
sites search either the web site or the internet using these customizable search boxes, we display relevant ads on the search results pages, targeted to match user search queries. Ads shown through AdSense for search are text ads.  AdSense for content is our online service for distributing ads from our advertisers that are relevant to content on our Google Network members' web sites.
Under this program, we use automated technology to analyze the meaning of the content on the web page and serve relevant ads based on the meaning of such content. For example, a web page on an automotive blog that contains an entry about vintage
cars might display ads for vintage car parts or vintage car shows. These ads are displayed in spaces that our AdSense for content partners have set aside on their web sites. AdSense for content allows a variety of ad types to be shown, including
text ads, image ads, Google Video Ads, link units (which are sets of clickable links to topic pages related to page content), themed units (which are regular text ads with graphic treatments that change seasonally and by geography) and gadget ads
(which are customized mini-sites that run as ads on AdSense publisher web sites).

Table of Contents
For our online AdSense program, our advertisers pay us a fee each time a user clicks on one of our
advertisers' ads displayed on our Google Network members' web sites or, for those advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as their ads are displayed. To date, we have paid most of these advertiser fees to our Google Network
members, and we expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the portion of the advertiser fee we pay to our Google Network members as traffic acquisition costs under cost of revenues. In
some cases, we guarantee our Google Network members minimum revenue share payments based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. Google Network members do not pay any fees
associated with the use of our AdSense program on their web sites.  Our agreements with Google Network members consist largely of uniform online
click-wrap agreements that members enter into by interacting with our registration web sites. The standard agreements have no stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both
the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements contain provisions requiring us to share with the Google Network member most of the advertiser fees generated by users clicking on ads on the Google Network member's web site or, for
advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as the ads are displayed on the Google Network member's web site.  Google TV Ads enables
advertisers, operators and programmers to buy, schedule, deliver and measure ads on television. We recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time an ad is displayed on television.  DoubleClick provides us with a platform for delivering display advertising. DoubleClick offers online ad serving and management services to advertisers, ad
agencies and web site publishers. Fees derived from hosted or web-based applications are recognized as licensing and other revenues in the period the advertising impressions are delivered.  We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. Our agreements with content
providers are typically standard agreements with no stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements contain provisions requiring us to
pay the content providers for the content we license. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these
ads generate with the content providers and Google Network members. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue. We recognize the portion of the advertiser fees we pay to our content providers as content acquisition costs under cost of revenues
and the portion we pay to our Google Network members as traffic acquisition costs. In some cases, we guarantee our content providers minimum revenue share or other payments.  We believe the factors that influence the success of our advertising programs include the following:

Trends in Our Business  Our business has grown rapidly since inception, resulting in substantially increased revenues, and we expect that our business will continue to grow. However, our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time, and we expect it will
continue to do so as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition, the difficulty of maintaining growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels and increasing maturity of the online advertising market in certain
countries. In addition, the general economic downturn may result in fewer commercial queries by our users and may cause advertisers to reduce the amount they spend on online advertising, including the amount they are willing to pay for each click or
impression, which could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues.  The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and
useful advertising to our users, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our web sites and our Google Network
members' web sites. These steps include not displaying ads that generate low click-through rates or that send users to irrelevant or otherwise low quality sites and terminating our relationships with those Google Network members whose web sites
do not meet our quality requirements. We may also continue to take steps to reduce the number of accidental clicks by our users. These steps could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues.  Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage
generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results,
including fluctuations in sequential revenues, as well as paid click and average cost-per-click growth rates.  The operating margin we realize on
revenues generated from ads placed on our Google Network members' web sites through our AdSense program is significantly lower than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from ads placed on our web sites because most of the
advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network members' web sites are shared with our Google Network members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from our web sites has exceeded that from our Google Network members'
web sites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future, although the relative rate of growth in revenues from our web sites compared to the rate of growth in
revenues from our Google Network members' web sites may vary over time.  We continue to invest in building the necessary employee and systems
infrastructures required to manage our growth and develop and promote our products and services, and this may cause our operating margins to decrease. We have generally experienced and expect to continue to experience growth in our operations as we
build our research and development programs, expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members and content providers, and increase our presence in international markets. Also, we have acquired and expect to continue to acquire businesses
and other assets from time to time. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies and our product offerings. Our full-time employee headcount has increased
over the last 12 months, growing from 19,156 at March31, 2008 to 20,164 at March31, 2009. We have recently made efforts to improve the discipline of our hiring process and to focus on better managing our expense growth. However, we
expect to continue to invest in our business, and this may cause our operating margins to decrease.  We expect our cost of revenues to increase in
dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs and credit card and other transaction fees, as well as content acquisition costs.
In particular, traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may increase in the future if we are unable to continue to improve the monetization or generation of revenue from traffic on our web sites and our Google Network
members' web sites, particularly with those members to whom we have guaranteed minimum revenue share payments.  Our international revenues have
grown as a percentage of our total revenues to 52% in the three months ended March31, 2009 from 50% in the three months ended December31, 2008 and from 51% in the three months ended March31, 2008. This increase in the portion of
our revenues derived from international markets results largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs, increases in our direct sales resources and customer support operations and our continued progress in developing localized
versions of our products in these international markets. The increase in the proportion of international revenues derived from international markets increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. For
example, in the first quarter of 2009, the 
25 
Table of Contents
strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the British pound and the Euro) had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. We have a foreign
exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies, however this program will not fully offset the effect of fluctuations on our revenues and earnings.  Results of Operations  The following table presents our historical

The growth in our advertising revenues in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the three months
ended March31, 2008 resulted from an increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs, partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The increase in the number of paid
clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements and the continued global expansion of our products, our advertiser base and our user base. The decrease in the average
cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was primarily the result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the British pound and the Euro). In addition, the decrease in the average cost-per-click was due to how
we believe advertisers managed their advertising costs in response to the general economic downturn. Specifically, we believe that as a result of the general economic downturn, advertisers, in aggregate, have lowered their bids for keywords in
response to a decrease in the sales they are able to make per paid click.  During this period, advertising revenue growth for Google web sites
resulted primarily from an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements and the continued global expansion of our products, our advertiser base and our user base. The decrease in advertising revenue from Google Network
members' sites resulted primarily from the termination of certain Google Network member relationships whose web sites did not meet our quality requirements, as well as certain other quality improvements, which adversely affected our revenues.
The decline in our advertising revenues in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the three months ended December31, 2008
resulted from the traditional retail seasonality trends affecting our business as well as a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers, partially offset by the increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our
advertising programs. The decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was, in addition to the seasonality trend noted above, the result of how we believe advertisers managed their advertising costs in response to the general
economic downturn. The increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic both on our web sites and the web sites of our Google Network members, certain monetization improvements and
the continued global expansion of our products, our advertiser base and our user base.  Improvements in our ability to ultimately monetize increased
traffic primarily relate to enhancing the end user experience, including providing end users with ads that are more relevant to their search queries or to the content on the Google Network members' web sites they visit. These improvements have
included, for instance, a change to the formula used to determine which ads appear at the top of our search results pages, a change to the clickable area around our AdSense for content text-based ads to only the title and URL to reduce the number of
accidental clicks, a change to report first-page bids which is an estimate of the bid it would take for an ad to reach the first page of our search results pages, as well as changes to further enhance the accuracy of our quality scoring, which is
our measurement of an ad's click-through rate and other relevancy factors.  Aggregate paid clicks on Google web sites and our Google Network
members' web sites increased 17% from the three months ended March31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009 and 3% from the three months ended December31, 2008 to the three months ended March 31, 2009. Average
cost-per-click on Google web sites and our Google Network members' web sites decreased 14% from the three months ended March31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009 and 6% from the three months ended December31, 2008
to the three months ended March31, 2009. The rate of change in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click, and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated or may in the future fluctuate because of various
factors including the revenue growth rates on our web sites compared to those of our Google Network members, advertiser competition for keywords, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, seasonality, the fees advertisers are willing to pay based
on how they manage their advertising costs, and the general economic downturn. In addition, traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals also contributes to these fluctuations. Changes
in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click may not be indicative of our performance or advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry.

Revenues by Geography  Domestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our advertisers are set forth below (unaudited):  
The growth in international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues in the three months ended
March31, 2009 compared to the three months ended March31, 2008 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs, increases in our direct sales resources and customer support operations in international markets and
our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets. The growth in international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the
three months ended December31, 2008 resulted from seasonally stronger traffic in the United Kingdom and certain other countries.  The
strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the British pound and the Euro) in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the three months ended March31, 2008 had an unfavorable impact on our
international revenues (international revenues increased $231.4million during this period). Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our total revenues would have been approximately $429million, or 7.8%, higher.
This is before consideration of hedging gains recognized to revenue of $154.1million and zero in the three months ended March31, 2009 and March31, 2008.  The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the British pound and the Euro) in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the three months ended December31, 2008 had an
unfavorable impact on our international revenues (international revenues increased $19.1million during this period). Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our total revenues in the three months ended March31,
2009 would have been approximately $120million, or 2.2%, higher. This is before consideration of hedging gains recognized to revenue of $154.1million and $128.9million in the three months ended March31, 2009 and
December31, 2008.  Although we expect to continue to make investments in international markets, they may not result in an increase in our
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2009 or thereafter. See Note13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in PartI, Item1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information
about geographic areas.  Costs and Expenses  Cost of
Revenues.  Cost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our
Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our web site
(collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share arrangements with our Google Network members and distribution partners.  Certain AdSense agreements obligate us to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google Network members based on their achieving defined performance
terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. These fees may be paid in advance or in arrears and are non-refundable but are subject to adjustment based on the achievement of the defined performance terms. In addition, the
arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our Google Network members may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. To the extent we expect revenues generated under an arrangement to
exceed the guaranteed minimum revenue share payments, we recognize traffic acquisition costs on a contractual revenue share basis or on a basis proportionate to forecasted revenues, whichever is greater. Otherwise, we recognize the guaranteed
revenue share payments 
28 
Table of Contents
as traffic acquisition costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the related agreements. For other AdSense agreements under which we only pay on a contractual
revenue share basis, we recognize the revenue share obligations as traffic acquisition costs at the same time the related revenue is recognized. Also, concurrent with the commencement of a small number of AdSense and other agreements, we have
purchased certain items from, or provided other consideration to, our Google Network members and partners. We have determined that certain of these amounts are prepaid traffic acquisition costs and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the related agreements.  In addition, certain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point
delivered and not exclusivelyor at allbased on revenue share. The fees are non-refundable. Further, the arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts, we or our distribution partners may be subject to
penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based
on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenue.  Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy and bandwidth costs, credit
card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets as well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute
or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements we display ads on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate
with the content providers and the Google Network members. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share or other payments to our content providers, we recognize content acquisition costs equal to the greater of the
following three amounts: the contractual revenue share amount, if any, an amount that is based on the number of times the content is displayed, or an amount calculated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the agreements. The following tables
present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and our traffic acquisition costs and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):
Cost of revenues decreased $9.0 million from the three months ended March31, 2008 to the three months
ended March31, 2009. Over the same period there was a decrease in traffic acquisition costs of $50.4 million primarily as a result of less revenues generated through our AdSense program. This decrease was also a result of more revenues
realized from Google Network members to whom we pay lower revenue share and less revenues realized from those members to whom we pay more revenue share. This decrease was offset by an increase in data center costs of $36.8 million primarily
resulting from the depreciation of additional information technology assets and data center buildings and an increase in the amortization of intangible assets of $14.2 million as a result of recognizing a full quarter of amortization expense in the
three months ended March31, 2009 related to our acquisition of DoubleClick. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of advertising revenues coming
from our web sites rather than from our Google Network members' web sites as well as an increase in revenue recognized from gains realized under our foreign exchange risk management program.

Cost of revenues decreased $88.5 million from the three months ended December31, 2008 to the three months
ended March31, 2009. Over this same period there was a decrease in traffic acquisition costs of $47.4 million primarily as a result of less revenues generated through our AdSense program. This decrease was also a result of more revenues
realized from Google Network members to whom we pay lower revenue share and less revenues realized from those members to whom we pay more revenue share. In addition, there was a decrease in data center costs of $31.3 million primarily as a result of
a decrease in labor costs. The decrease in labor costs was primarily due to lower annual bonus expense recognized in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the three months ended December31, 2008.  We expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2009 and in future periods, primarily as a result of
forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, credit card and other transaction fees, content acquisition and other costs. Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may fluctuate in the future based on
a number of factors, including the following:  
Research and Development.  The following table presents
our research and development expenses, and research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel
responsible for the research and development of new products and services, as well as significant improvements to existing products and services. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.  Research and development expenses decreased $31.5 million from the three months ended March31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009. This
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $25.2 million as a result of certain acquisition related equity awards which fully vested during the second quarter of 2008.  Research and development expenses decreased $91.7 million from the three months ended December31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009. This
decrease was primarily due to lower annual bonus expense recognized in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the three months ended December31, 2008.  We expect that research and development expenses may increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenues in 2009 and future periods because we expect to
continue to invest in building the necessary employee and systems infrastructures required to support the development of new, and improve existing, products and services.

Sales and Marketing.  The following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel engaged in
customer service and sales and sales support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenditures.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased
$13.0 million from the three months ended March31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009 primarily due to a decrease in travel and related expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased $72.1 million from the three months ended December31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in labor and facilities
related costs of $41.2 million primarily due to lower annual bonus and commission expense recognized in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the three months ended December31, 2008.  We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses may increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenues in 2009 and future periods as we expand our business
on a worldwide basis.  General and Administrative.  The following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and
facilities related to our finance, human resources, facilities, information technology and legal organizations, and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information technology
consulting and outsourcing services.  General and administrative expenses increased $39.0 million in the three months ended March31, 2009
compared to the three months ended March31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to $26.3 million of expenses recognized related to the exit of our audio and print ads businesses, as well as severance benefits for the termination of certain
employees and an increase in legal costs of $29.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in consulting services of $15.6 million.  General and administrative expenses increased $36.9 million in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the three months ended December31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to $26.3 million of expenses recognized
related to the exit of our audio and print ads businesses, as well as severance benefits for the termination of certain employees. This increase was also due to an increase in legal costs of $17.0 million and an increase in bad debt expense of $10.1
million due to increased collection risk as a result of the general economic downturn. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in labor and facilities related costs of $25.6 million primarily due to lower annual bonus expense recognized
in the three months ended March31, 2009 compared to the three months ended December31, 2008.

Stock-Based Compensation.  The following table presents our stock-based compensation, and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
In March 2009, we completed an offer to exchange certain employee stock options issued under Google's
2004 Stock Plan (the Exchange). Certain previously granted options were exchanged for new stock options with a lower exercise price granted on a one-for-one basis. Options for an aggregate of approximately 7.6million shares of Google's
ClassA common stock were exchanged. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have an exercise price of $308.57 per share, the closing price of Google's ClassA common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market on
March6, 2009. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have a new vesting schedule determined by adding 12 months to each vesting date under the exchanged options' original vesting schedule. In addition, new options will vest no sooner
than six months after the date of the Exchange. The Exchange resulted in a modification charge of approximately $360 million which will be recognized over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting periods range from six months to
approximately five years. We recorded approximately $11 million of this $360 million modification charge in the three months ended March31, 2009.  Stock-based compensation decreased $3.3 million from the three months ended March31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009. Stock-based compensation decreased $8.7 million from the three months ended December31,
2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009.  We expect stock-based compensation to be approximately $1.1 billion in 2009 and $1.8 billion
thereafter. These amounts do not include stock-based compensation related to stock awards that have been and may be granted to employees and directors subsequent to March31, 2009 and stock awards that have been or may be granted to
non-employees. In addition, to the extent forfeiture rates are different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.  Impairment of Equity Investments  We have reviewed our equity investments
for impairment in accordance with FSP SFAS 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (FSP 115-1), and determined that certain of these investments are impaired. After consideration of the
duration and severity of the impairment, as well as the reasons for the decline in value and the potential recovery periods, we believe that such impairments were other-than-temporary at December31, 2008. As a result, in the fourth
quarter of 2008, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.09 billion, primarily comprising of $726.0 million and $355.0 million related to our investments in America Online, Inc. and Clearwire Corporation.  Interest Income and Other, Net  Interest income and other, net decreased
$161.1 million from the three months ended March31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of an increase in net foreign exchange related costs of $92.6 million and a decrease in interest
income of $55.9 million due to lower yields on our cash and investment balances.  Interest income and other, net decreased $63.7 million from the
three months ended December31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of an increase in net foreign exchange related costs of $41.5 million and a decrease in interest income of $22.4 million
due to lower yields on our cash and investment balances.  The costs of our foreign exchange hedging activity that we recognized to interest income
and other, net are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the volatility of the foreign exchange rates as well as the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike
prices of the contracts.  As we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activity under our foreign exchange risk
management program may increase in dollar amount in 2009 and future periods.

Provision for Income Taxes  The following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions, unaudited):  
Our provision for income taxes increased from the three months ended March31, 2008 to the three months
ended March31, 2009, primarily as a result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income period over period. Our effective tax rate increased from the three months ended March31, 2008 to the three months
ended March31, 2009, primarily as a result of certain discrete tax items which would reduce our future tax benefits.  Our provision for income
taxes increased from the three months ended December31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009, primarily as a result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income period over period. Our effective
tax rate decreased from the three months ended December31, 2008 to the three months ended March31, 2009, primarily as a result of the recognition of a tax benefit of only $82.3 million related to the impairment charge of equity
investments of $1.09 billion in the three months ended December31, 2008.  Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly
basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also
fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  In summary, our cash flows were as follows (in millions, unaudited):  
At March31, 2009, we had $17.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash
equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., time deposits, money market mutual funds, mortgage-backed securities and U.S. corporate
securities. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion on the composition of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our
operations. At December31, 2008 and March31, 2009, we had unused letters of credit of $109.9 million and $90.2 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be
sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services, including the impact of changes in customer
buying or advertiser spending behavior that may result from the general economic downturn. Also, if the banking system or the financial markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the value and
liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected. In addition, we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to
provide for greater flexibility to fund any such acquisitions and licensing activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.

Cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items including
depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities, and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended
March31, 2009 was $2,249.5 million and consisted of net income of $1,422.8 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $614.6 million and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $212.1 million. Adjustments for non-cash items
primarily consisted of $321.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $277.5 million of stock-based compensation and $82.1 million of amortization of intangibles and other, partially offset by $31.8 million of
excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities and $12.8 million of deferred income taxes. In addition, the increase in cash from changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred
income taxes of $324.8 million (which includes the same $31.8 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards included under adjustments for non-cash items), a decrease of $97.4 million in accounts receivable due to the decrease in fees
billed to our advertisers, a decrease of $77.5 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets primarily due to a decrease in the value of derivative assets and to a lesser extent by an increase in accounts payable of $21.9 million,
partially offset by a decrease of $322.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily as a result of employee bonuses for the year ended December31, 2008 paid in the first quarter of 2009. The increase in income taxes payable
and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, as well as less estimated income taxes paid, in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.  Cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended March31, 2008 was $1,779.4 million and consisted of net income of $1,307.1 million,
adjustments for non-cash items of $483.1 million and cash used in working capital and other activities of $10.8 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $280.8 million of stock-based compensation, $280.6 million of depreciation
and amortization expense on property and equipment and $56.0 million of amortization of intangibles and other, partially offset by $51.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital
activities primarily consisted of a decrease of $234.3 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily as a result of employee bonuses for the year ended December31, 2007 paid in the first quarter of 2008, and an increase of $223.5
million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers and an increase of $41.6 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, partially offset by a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income
taxes of $438.2 million (which includes the same $51.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards included under adjustments for non-cash items) and to a lesser extent by an increase in accounts payable of $53.8 million. The increase in
income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, as well as less estimated income taxes paid, in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  As we expand our business internationally, we have offered payment terms to certain advertisers that are standard in their locales, but longer than terms we would
generally offer to our domestic advertisers. This may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative effect on cash provided by our operating activities.  Cash used in investing activities in the three months ended March31, 2009 of $418.8 million was attributable to purchases of marketable securities of
$5,244.8 million and capital expenditures of $262.8 million, partially offset by the proceeds received from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $5,109.6 million. Cash used in investing activities in the three months ended
March31, 2008 of $1,407.0 million was attributable to cash consideration used in acquisitions of $3,125.1 million, primarily related to the DoubleClick acquisition, purchases of marketable securities of $2,819.5 million and capital
expenditures of $841.6 million, partially offset by the proceeds received from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $5,379.2 million.  Capital expenditures are mainly for the purchase of information technology assets. In order to manage expected increases in internet traffic, advertising transactions and new products and services, and to support our overall global business
expansion, we will make significant investments in data center operations, technology, corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure in 2009 and thereafter.  In addition, we expect to spend a significant amount of cash on acquisitions and other investments from time to time. These acquisitions generally enhance the
breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies and our product offerings. In connection with certain acquisitions, we are obligated to make additional cash payments if certain criteria are met. As of
March31, 2009, our remaining contingent obligations related to these acquisitions was approximately $37 million, which if the criteria are met, would be recorded as part of the purchase. Since these contingent payments are based on the
achievement of performance targets, actual payments may be substantially lower.

Cash used in financing activities in the three months ended March31, 2009 of $4.9 million was primarily due
to net payments related to stock-based award activities of $36.7 million, partially offset by excess tax benefits of $31.8 million from stock-based award activities during the period which represents a portion of the $65.5 million reduction to
income taxes payable that we recorded in the first quarter of 2009 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale or vesting of these awards. Net payments result when the tax withholding payments we make on behalf of our
employees upon the net settlement of their vested restricted stock units exceeds the cash we receive upon the exercise of stock options. Cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended March31, 2008 of $28.7 million was
primarily due to excess tax benefits of $51.1 million from stock-based award activities during the period which represents a portion of the $70.3 million reduction to income taxes payable that we recorded in the first quarter of 2008 related to the
total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale or vesting of these awards, as well as net payments related to stock-based award activities of $22.4 million.  Contractual Obligations  We are obligated under certain agreements to make non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to
Google Network members based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. At March31, 2009, our aggregate outstanding non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share commitments
totaled $671.4 million through 2012 compared to $1,030.3 million at December31, 2008.  In addition, we recorded additional long-term taxes
payable of $275.4 million in the three months ended March31, 2009 as FIN 48 specifies that tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain should be recognized as long-term liabilities. At this time, we are unable to
make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases,
we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our
estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we
believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our
critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.  Income Taxes  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and
determining our provision for income taxes.  Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be
given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax
outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions
and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.  Our effective tax rates have differed from the
statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, research and experimentation tax credits, state taxes, and certain benefits realized related to stock option activity. The effective tax rate was 54.2% and 24.7% for the three
months ended December31, 2008 and March31, 2009, respectively. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than
anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are
subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes.

Table of Contents
Stock-Based Compensation  We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No.123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Under the provisions of SFAS 123R,
stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The BSM model
requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that
recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. Further, to the
extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.  Traffic
Acquisition Costs  We are obligated under certain agreements to make non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google
Network members based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. To the extent we expect revenues generated under such an arrangement to exceed the guaranteed minimum revenue share
payments, we recognize traffic acquisition costs on a contractual revenue share basis or on a basis proportionate to forecasted revenues, whichever is greater; if our estimate of revenues under such an arrangement is subsequently revised downward,
then the amount of traffic acquisition costs we would recognize thereafter would be proportionately greater. Otherwise, we recognize the guaranteed revenue share payments as traffic acquisition costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the
related agreements.  Impairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities  We periodically review our marketable securities, as well asour non-marketable equity securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments
are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporaryas defined under FSP 115-1. Factors we consider to make such a determination includethe duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the
decline invalueand the potential recovery period, and our intent and ability to hold an investment. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding
charge to our Consolidated Statement of Income.  Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from
Contingencies, which amends and clarifies the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and related disclosures of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination under SFAS 141R.
This FSP is effective for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after December15, 2008. We adopted this FSP in the first quarter of 2009 and the impact of the
adoption on our consolidated financial statements largely depends on the size and nature of the business combinations.  In April 2009, the FASB
issued FSP No. FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Note Orderly, which provides additional guidance for
estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS 157. This FSP states that a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability when compared with normal market activity is an indication that transactions or quoted
prices may not be determinative of fair value because there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly in such market conditions. Accordingly, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant
adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value. This FSP is effective for us beginning April1, 2009. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this FSP to be material on our consolidated financial
statements.  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,
which requires disclosures about the fair value of our financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value, whether recognized or not recognized in the balance sheets, in the interim reporting periods as well as in the annual
reporting periods. In addition, the FSP requires disclosures of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of those financial instruments. This FSP is effective for us beginning April1, 2009. We do not expect the
impact of the adoption of this FSP to be material on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments, which establishes a new method of recognizing and reporting other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities and requires additional disclosures related to debt and equity securities. This FSP does not change
existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. This FSP is effective for us beginning April1, 2009. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this FSP to be material on our
consolidated financial statements.  Available Information  Our web site is located at www.google.com, and our investor relations web site is located at http://investor.google.com. The following filings are available through our investor relations web site after we file them with the

We are
exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.  Foreign Exchange Risk  Economic Exposure  We transact business in various foreign
currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies. This exposes us to foreign currency risk. We purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily
related to forecasted revenue denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign
currency exchange rate. In accordance with SFAS 133, these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and
subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest income and other, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. Any gain after a hedge is de-designated because the hedged transaction
is no longer probable of occurring or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest income and other, net, immediately.  At
December31, 2008, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 1.9 billion (or approximately
$2.6 billion) and $152.0 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were 1.1 billion (or approximately $1.8 billion) and $277.9 million; and the notional principal
and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$229.7million (or approximately $202.2 million) and $21.8 million. These foreign exchange options have maturities of 18 months or less. There
were no other foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. At March31, 2009, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 2.1 billion (or approximately $2.8 billion) and $166.2 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were 1.1
billion (or approximately $1.7 billion) and $210.2 million; and the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$261.8million (or approximately $216.7 million) and $15.3
million. These foreign exchange options have maturities of 18 months or less. There are no other foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. However, we may enter into similar contracts in other foreign currencies in the future.

We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that
changes in exchange rates of 20% for our foreign currencies instruments could be experienced in the near term.  If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20%,
the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income before tax effect would have been approximately $273 million lower at March31, 2009, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest income and other, net, would have been
approximately $47 million higher in the three months ended March31, 2009. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income before tax effect would have been approximately $789 million higher
at March31, 2009, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest income and other, net, would have been approximately $104 million higher in the three months ended March31, 2009.  Transaction Exposure  Our exposure to foreign currency
transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, primarily the Euro, the British pound and the
Japanese yen. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency. We have entered into foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than
the local currency of the subsidiary. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $2.6 billion and $2.1 billion at December31, 2008 and March31, 2009. The notional principal
of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $54.2 million and $97.4 million at December31, 2008 and March31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other
currencies was 630.5million (or approximately $897.6 million) and 476.7million (or approximately $634.3 million) at December31, 2008 and March31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for other currencies was 4.0million (or approximately $5.3 million) at March31, 2009.  We considered the
historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse
impact on income before income taxes of approximately $16 million and $1 million at December31, 2008 and March31, 2009. The adverse impact at December31, 2008 and March31, 2009 is after consideration of the offsetting effect
of approximately $555million and $546 million from forward exchange contracts in place for the months of December 2008 and March 2009. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets
denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before taxes in the near term.  Interest Rate Risk  We invest our excess cash primarily
in highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., time deposits, money market mutual funds, mortgage-backed securities and corporate securities. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to
any one issuer.  Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate
securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our income from investments
may decrease in the future.  We considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that
an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis-point) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately $83
million and $65 million at December31, 2008 and March31, 2009.

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures.  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  Based onour evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a
reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting to ensure we maintain an effective internal control environment. As we grow
geographically and with new product offerings, we continue to create new processes and controls as well as improve our existing environment to increase efficiencies. Improvements may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient
systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART IIOTHER INFORMATION  
From time to time, we are involved in a variety of
claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax and other matters. Although
claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of our current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible
that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. See the risk factors Our intellectual
property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand and We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to
defend, could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future in the Risks Related to Our Business and Industry section of Part II, Item1A of this Quarterly Report on
Form10-Q.  EPA Investigation  In February
2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller data facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We
are cooperating with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials. The EPA investigation could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other administrative action.  While we currently believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows, we have noted it in accord with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that call for disclosure of certain environmental proceedings that may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.  
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry  We face significant competition from web search providers, internet advertising companies, online service and content providers, and traditional media
companies.  We face significant competition in every aspect of our business. This includes competition from web search providers, internet
advertising companies, companies that provide products and services online, and companies that provide online content. Our competitors include companies ranging from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have
longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and end users, and they can use their experience and resources against us in a variety of competitive ways, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in
research and development, and competing aggressively for advertisers and web sites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can.  In certain markets outside the U.S., other web search, advertising services, and internet companies have greater brand recognition, more users, and more search
traffic than we have. Even in countries where we have a significant user following, we may not be as successful in generating advertising revenue due to slower market development, our inability to provide attractive local advertising services, or
other factors. To compete more effectively, we need to better understand our international users and their preferences, improve our brand recognition, enhance our selling efforts internationally, and build stronger relationships with advertisers. If
we fail to do so, our global expansion efforts may be more costly and less profitable than we expect.  In addition to competition from internet
advertising companies, internet advertising companies such as Google face substantial competition from companies that offer traditional media advertising services. Most large advertisers allocate only a small portion of their overall advertising
budgets to internet advertising, and we expect that large advertisers will continue to focus most of their advertising efforts on traditional media. If we fail to convince these companies to spend a portion of their advertising budgets with us, or
if our existing advertisers reduce the amount they spend on our programs, our operating results will be harmed.

We expect our revenue growth rate to decline and anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the
future.  We believe our revenue growth rate will generally decline as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition, the
inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels, the increasing maturity of the online advertising market and, more recently, the significant global economic crisis. We believe our operating margin will experience
downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business. Our operating margin will also experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our
Google Network members' web sites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own web sites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Toolbar. The margin on
revenue we generate from our Google Network members is significantly less than the margin on revenue we generate from advertising on our web sites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenue generated from our Google Network members could decrease
in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network members.  Our operating results may fluctuate,
which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.  Our operating results may fluctuate
as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.
Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause
our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this Item1A and the following factors may affect our operating results:  
Because our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. In addition,
advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns. For example, in 1999, advertisers spent heavily on internet advertising. This was followed by a lengthy
downturn in ad spending on the web. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has
become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.

If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not
remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.  Our success depends on providing products and services that make
using the internet a more useful and enjoyable experience for our users. Our competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising and web based products and services. As a result, we must continue to invest significant
resources in research and development in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality
products and services, then our users may become dissatisfied and move to a competitor's products and services. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if
users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers and Google Network members, are not
appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market. As search technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer search results that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or
better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.  We generate
our revenue almost entirely from advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.  We
generated 97% of our revenues in both 2008 and the first three months of 2009 from our advertisers. Our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment
in advertising with us does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall
economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would negatively harm our revenues and business.  The effects of the recent global economic crisis may impact our business, operating results, or financialcondition.  The recent global economic crisis has caused disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy, and has
impacted levels of consumer spending. These macroeconomic developments have negatively affected and may continue to affect our business, operating results, or financial condition in a number of ways. For example, current or potential customers may
delay or decrease spending with us, may have difficulty paying us, or may delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. This may also require us to increase our bad debt reserve and may affect how we recognize accounts receivables.
In addition, if consumer spending continues to decrease, this may result in fewer clicks on our advertisers' ads displayed on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites. Finally, if the banking system or the financial markets
continue to deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected.  We rely on our Google Network members for a significant portion of our revenues, and we benefit from our association with them. The loss of these members could adversely affect our business.  We provide advertising, web search and other services to our Google Network members, which accounted for 31% of our revenues in 2008 and 30% of our revenues in the
three months ended March31, 2009. Some of the participants in this network may compete with us in one or more areas. They may decide in the future to terminate their agreements with us. If our Google Network members decide to use a
competitor's or their own web search or advertising services, our revenues would decline. Our agreements with a few of the largest Google Network members account for a significant portion of revenues derived from our AdSense program. If our
relationship with one or more large Google Network members were terminated or renegotiated on terms less favorable to us, our business could be adversely affected.  Also, certain of our key Google Network members operate high-profile web sites, and we derive tangible and intangible benefits from this affiliation. If one or more of these key relationships is terminated or not renewed, and
is not replaced with a comparable relationship, our business would be adversely affected.

Our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our
business and operating results could be harmed.  We have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will
continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and
operating results. Our expansion and growth in international markets heighten these risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems,
alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. These
systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position.  Our business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers and
Google Network members.  The brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining
and enhancing the Google brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members, and other partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to
entry in the internet market. If we fail to maintain and enhance the Google brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.
Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.  Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.  We do not have a great deal of experience acquiring companies, and the companies we have acquired have typically been small. However, recently, we have closed a
number of larger acquisitions, including our acquisitions of DoubleClick and Postini, and are in the process of integrating these businesses into our own. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of
potential strategic transactions. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology has created, and will continue to create unforeseen
operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:  
Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments,
incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.  
43 
Table of Contents
Future acquisitions or dispositions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the
incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. For example, we have yet
to realize significant revenue benefits from our acquisition of YouTube.  Our international operations are subject to increased risks which
could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.  International revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our total
revenues in 2008 and approximately 52% of our total revenues in the first three months of 2009. More than half of our user traffic came from outside the U.S. in the first three months of 2009. We have limited experience with operations outside the
U.S. and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:  
In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in
international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws,
sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws
and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries,
and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.  Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.
Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside
of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are
distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our
ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.

Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some
of these innovations. Changes in patent law, such as changes in the law regarding patentable subject matter, can also impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our innovations. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we
may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed
invalid or unenforceable.  We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word Google could
become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word Google to refer to their own products,
thus diminishing our brand.  We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside
parties, or by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.  We are, and may in
the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.  Companies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into
litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase. Our products, services and
technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims and regardless of the merits of the claim, intellectual property claims are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are
successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue any of our services or practices that are found to be in violation of another party's rights.  We also may have to seek a license to continue such practices, which may significantly increase our operating expenses. In addition, many of our agreements with
our Google Network members and other partners require us to indemnify these members for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay
damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims.  Companies have filed trademark infringement and related claims against us over the
display of ads in response to user queries that include trademark terms. The outcomes of these lawsuits have differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We currently have three cases pending at the European Court of Justice, which will address
questions regarding whether advertisers and search engines can be held liable for use of trademarked terms in keyword advertising. We are litigating, or have recently litigated similar issues in other cases, in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Brazil,
China, France, Germany, Israel, and Italy.  We have also had copyright claims filed against us by companies alleging that features of certain of our
products and services, including Google Web Search, Google News, Google Video, Google Image Search, Google Book Search, and YouTube, infringe the rights of others. In the U.S. we announced a settlement with the Authors Guild and the Association of
American Publishers; however, this class action settlement is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and we are subject to additional claims with respect to Google Book Search in other parts of the
world. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain functionalities, and may also result in a change in our business
practices, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or otherwise harm our business. In addition, any time one of our products or services links to or hosts material in which others allegedly own copyrights, we face the risk of being sued for
copyright infringement or related claims. Because these products and services comprise the majority of our products and services, the risk of harm from such lawsuits could be substantial.  We have also had patent lawsuits filed against us alleging that certain of our products and services, including Google Web Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense,
and Google Chrome, infringe patents held by others. In addition, the number of demands for license fees and the dollar amounts associated with each request continue to increase. Adverse results in these lawsuits, or our decision to license patents
based upon these demands, may result in substantial costs and, in the case of adverse litigation rulings, could prevent us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or
otherwise harm our business.

Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users
from using our products and services.  From time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products and services compromise the
privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results.
While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or
others, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.  In addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web based, the
amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users' data could seriously limit the adoption of
our products and services as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our
business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web based products and services we offer as well as increase the number of countries where we operate.  Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of data protection laws in Europe and elsewhere are still
uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our
data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.  A variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.  We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and
effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies. Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related
technologies. The laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled
both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have been threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign law for defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement, or other
theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users.  In addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing or linking to third-party web sites that include materials that infringe copyrights or
other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. The Child Online Protection Act and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose
additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as
California's Information Practices Act. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.  We are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.  The growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues and may subject us to increased regulatory
scrutiny, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Moreover, our competitors have employed and will likely continue to employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations. Legislators
and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, or change our business practices. These changes
or increased costs could negatively impact our business.

More individuals are using non-PC devices to access the internet. If users of these devices do not widely
adopt versions of our web search technology, products or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.  The number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart phones and handheld computers and video game consoles, as well as television
set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality and memory associated with alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult and the versions of
our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products
and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. As we have limited experience to date in operating versions of our products and services, including Google Mobile and Android, developed or optimized for users of alternative
devices and as new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote
significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors and users to our products and services or if we are slow to
develop products and technologies that are more compatible with non-PC devices, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business.
Our business may be adversely affected by malicious applications that interfere with, or exploit security flaws in, our products and services.
Our business may be adversely affected by malicious applications that make changes to our users' computers and interfere with the Google
experience. These applications have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to change our users' internet experience, including hijacking queries to Google.com, altering or replacing Google search results, or otherwise interfering
with our ability to connect with our users. The interference often occurs without disclosure to or consent from users, resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with Google. These applications may be difficult or impossible to
uninstall or disable, may reinstall themselves and may circumvent other applications' efforts to block or remove them. In addition, we offer a number of products and services that our users download to their computers or that they rely on to
store information and transmit information to others over the internet. These products and services are subject to attack by viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, which could jeopardize the security of information stored in a
user's computer or in our computer systems and networks. The ability to reach users and provide them with a superior experience is critical to our success. If our efforts to combat these malicious applications are unsuccessful, or if our
products and services have actual or perceived vulnerabilities, our reputation may be harmed and our user traffic could decline, which would damage our business.  Proprietary document formats may limit the effectiveness of our search technology by preventing our technology from accessing the content of documents in such formats, which could limit the effectiveness of our products
and services.  A large amount of information on the internet is provided in proprietary document formats such as Microsoft Word. The providers
of the software application used to create these documents could engineer the document format to prevent or interfere with our ability to access the document contents with our search technology. This would mean that the document contents would not
be included in our search results even if the contents were directly relevant to a search. The software providers may also seek to require us to pay them royalties in exchange for giving us the ability to search documents in their format. If the
software provider also competes with us in the search business, they may give their search technology a preferential ability to search documents in their proprietary format. Any of these results could harm our brand and our operating results.
New technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.  Technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the
display of ads on web pages. As a result, ad-blocking technology could adversely affect our operating results.

If we fail to detect click fraud or other invalid clicks, we could face additional litigation as well as lose
the confidence of our advertisers, which would cause our business to suffer.  We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks and other
invalid clicks on our ads from a variety of potential sources. We have regularly refunded fees that our advertisers have paid to us that were later attributed to click fraud and other invalid clicks, and we expect to do so in the future. Invalid
clicks are clicks that we have determined are not intended by the user to link to the underlying content, such as inadvertent clicks on the same ad twice and clicks resulting from click fraud. Click fraud occurs when a user intentionally clicks on a
Google AdWords ad displayed on a web site for a reason other than to view the underlying content. If we are unable to stop these invalid clicks, these refunds may increase. If we find new evidence of past invalid clicks we may issue refunds
retroactively of amounts previously paid to our Google Network members. This would negatively affect our profitability, and these invalid clicks could hurt our brand. If invalid clicks are not detected, the affected advertisers may experience a
reduced return on their investment in our advertising programs because the invalid clicks will not lead to potential revenue for the advertisers. This could lead the advertisers to become dissatisfied with our advertising programs, which has led to
litigation alleging click fraud and could lead to further litigation, as well as to a loss of advertisers and revenues.  Interruption or
failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.  The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are
vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers
are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties.
Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons or
other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities
in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our brand.  Index spammers could harm the integrity of our web search results, which could damage our reputation and cause our users to be dissatisfied with our products
and services.  There is an ongoing and increasing effort by index spammers to develop ways to manipulate our web search results.
For example, because our web search technology ranks a web page's relevance based in part on the importance of the web sites that link to it, people have attempted to link a group of web sites together to manipulate web search results. We take
this problem very seriously because providing relevant information to users is critical to our success. If our efforts to combat these and other types of index spamming are unsuccessful, our reputation for delivering relevant information could be
diminished. This could result in a decline in user traffic, which would damage our business.  If we were to lose the services of Eric, Larry,
Sergey or other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.  Our future success depends in a
large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, our CEO, Eric Schmidt, and our founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are critical to the overall management of Google as well as the development of
our technology, our culture and our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of any of our management or key personnel could
seriously harm our business.  We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified
personnel or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.  Our performance largely depends on the talents and
efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified
employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and
motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.

In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork. As our organization
grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.
We have a short operating history and a relatively new business model in an emerging and rapidly evolving market. This makes it difficult to
evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not continue to be successful.  We first derived revenue from our online
search business in 1999 and from our advertising services in 2000, and we have only a short operating history with our cost-per-click advertising model, which we launched in 2002 and our cost-per-impression advertising model which we launched in
2005. As a result, we have only a short operating history to aid in assessing our future prospects. Also, we derive nearly all of our revenues from online advertising, which is an immature industry that has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in
its short history. We will encounter risks and difficulties as a company operating in a new and rapidly evolving market. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could materially harm our business and operating
results.  We may have difficulty scaling and adapting our existing architecture to accommodate increased traffic and technology advances or
changing business requirements, which could lead to the loss of users, advertisers and Google Network members, and cause us to incur expenses to make architectural changes.  To be successful, our network infrastructure has to perform well and be reliable. The greater the user traffic and the greater the complexity of our products and
services, the more computing power we will need. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on the purchase and lease of data centers and equipment and the upgrade of our technology and network infrastructure to handle
increased traffic on our web sites and to roll out new products and services. This expansion is expensive and complex and could result in inefficiencies or operational failures. If we do not expand successfully, or if we experience inefficiencies
and operational failures, the quality of our products and services and our users' experience could decline. This could damage our reputation and lead us to lose current and potential users, advertisers and Google Network members. Cost
increases, loss of traffic or failure to accommodate new technologies or changing business requirements could harm our operating results and financial condition.  We rely on bandwidth providers, data centers and others in providing products and services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services and products provided by these third parties could damage our
reputation and harm our ability to operate our business.  We rely on vendors, including data center and bandwidth providers in providing
products and services to our users. Any disruption in the network access or colocation services provided by these providers or any failure of these providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm our business. Any
financial or other difficulties our providers face may have negative effects on our business. We exercise little control over these vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We license technology and
related databases to facilitate aspects of our data center and connectivity operations including internet traffic management services. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service and availability for
such elements. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays in connection with these technologies and information services could harm our relationship with users, adversely affect our brand and expose us to liabilities.  Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade or charge
for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.  Our
products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing
market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies and mobile communications companies. Some of these providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt
or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. These
activities may be permitted in the U.S. after recent regulatory changes, including recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and Federal Communications Commission. While interference with access to our popular products and services seems unlikely,
such carrier interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenue and growth.

To the extent our revenues are paid in foreign currencies, and currency exchange rates become unfavorable, we
may lose some of the economic value of the revenues in U.S. dollar terms.  As we expand our international operations, more of our customers
may pay us in foreign currencies. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. For instance, if the currency exchange rates were to change unfavorably, the U.S. dollar equivalent
of our operating income recorded in foreign currencies would be diminished. Hedging strategies, such as forward contracts, options and foreign exchange swaps that we have implemented or may implement to mitigate this risk may not reduce or
completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Additionally, hedging programs expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial results, including the following:  
Payments to certain of our Google Network members have exceeded the related fees we receive from our advertisers.  We are obligated under certain agreements to make non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google Network members based on their achieving
defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. In these agreements, we promise to make these minimum payments to the Google Network member for a pre-negotiated period of time. At March31, 2009, our
aggregate outstanding non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share commitments totaled $671.4 million through 2012 compared to $1.03 billion at December31, 2008. It is difficult to forecast with certainty the fees that we will earn under
agreements with guarantees, and sometimes the fees we earn fall short of the guaranteed minimum payment amounts.  We rely on outside providers
for our worldwide billing, collection, payment processing and payroll. If these outside service providers are not able to fulfill their service obligations, our business and operations could be disrupted, and our operating results could be harmed.
Outside providers perform various functions for us, such as worldwide billing, collection, payment processing and payroll. These functions
are critical to our operations and involve sensitive interactions between us and our advertisers, Google Network members and employees. Although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls, if we do not
successfully manage our service providers or if the service providers do not perform satisfactorily to agreed-upon service levels, our operations could be disrupted resulting in advertiser, partner or employee dissatisfaction. In addition, our
business, reputation and operating results could be adversely affected.

We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.  Our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher
than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws,
regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review could have a negative effect on our operating
results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for
which such determination is made.  Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock  The trading price for our ClassA common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.  The trading price of our ClassA common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering and will likely continue to be volatile. The trading price of
our ClassA common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:  
In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price
and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our ClassA common stock, regardless of
our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This
litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.  We
do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.  We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock. We currently
intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.  The concentration of our capital stock
ownership with our founders, executive officers and our directors and their affiliates will limit our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.  Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our ClassA common stock has one vote per share. As of March31, 2009, our founders, executive officers and directors (and their affiliates) together owned shares of
ClassA common stock, Class B common stock and other equity interests representing approximately 71% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. In particular, as of March31, 2009, our two founders and our CEO, Larry, Sergey and
Eric, owned approximately 90% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 68% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and
over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control limits
our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our ClassA common stock could be adversely affected.

Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may
consider favorable.  Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of
control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:  
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business
combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to
prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
