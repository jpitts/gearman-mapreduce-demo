PART I  
Overview  Google is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. Our innovations in web search and advertising have
made our web site a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. We maintain a large index of web sites and other online content, which we make freely available via our search engine to anyone with an internet
connection. Our automated search technology helps people obtain nearly instant access to relevant information from our vast online index.  We generate revenue primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. Businesses use our AdWords program to promote their products and services with targeted advertising. In addition, the third-party web sites that
comprise the Google Network use our AdSense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenue and enhance the user experience.  We
were incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in August 2003. Our headquarters are located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, and our telephone number is (650)253-0000. 
Our Mission  Our mission is to organize the
world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. We believe that the most effective, and ultimately the most profitable, way to accomplish our mission is to put the needs of our users first. We have found that offering a
high-quality user experience leads to increased traffic and strong word-of-mouth promotion. Our dedication to putting users first is reflected in three key commitments:  
We believe that our user focus is the foundation of our success to date. We also believe that this focus is critical
for the creation of long-term value. We do not intend to compromise our user focus for short-term economic gain.  How We Provide Value to Our Users
We serve our users by developing products that quickly and easily find, create, organize, and share information. We place a premium on
products that matter to many people and have the potential to improve their lives.  Some of the key benefits we offer include:
Comprehensiveness and Relevance. Our search technologies sort through a vast and growing amount of information to deliver
relevant and useful search results in response to user queries. This is an area of continual development for us. When we started the company in 1998, our web index contained approximately 30million
1 
Table of Contents
documents. We now index billions of web pages and strive to provide the most comprehensive search experience possible.Our team continually improves our relevance algorithms to objectively
determine the best answers to our users' queries and to place these answers at the top of our search results.We are also constantly developing new functionality and enhancing our offerings to allow our users to more quickly and easily
find information.  Objectivity.We believe it is very important that the results users get from Google are produced with
only their interests in mind. We do not accept payment for search result ranking or inclusion. We do accept fees for advertising, but the advertising is clearly marked and separated and does not influence how we generate our search results.
Inclusion and frequent updating in our index are open to all sites free of charge. We believe it is important for users to have access to the best available information, not just the information that someone pays for them to see.  Global Access. We strive to provide our services to everyone in the world, and the Google interface is available in 112 languages. Through
Google News, we offer an automated collection of frequently updated news stories in 30 languages covering sources from almost 60 countries. We also offer automatic translation of content between various languages and provide localized versions of
Google in many developing countries.  Ease of Use.We have always believed that the most useful and powerful search
technology hides its complexity from users and gives them a simple, intuitive way to get the information they want. We have devoted significant efforts to creating a streamlined and easy-to-use interface based on a clean search box set prominently
on a page free of commercial clutter. We introduce new navigational or informational features when we believe they will be most useful to our users, and only after extensive usability testing and experimentation.  Pertinent, Useful Commercial Information.The search for information often involves an interest in commercial informationresearching
a purchase, comparing products and services, or actively shopping. We help people find commercial information through our search services and advertising products. We also present advertisements that are relevant to the information people seek. Our
technology automatically rewards ads that users prefer and removes ads that they do not find helpful.  Multiple Access
Platforms.The mobile phone is the primary way that many people around the world access the internet. We have continued to invest in improving mobile search and have introduced applications that allow users to access search, email, maps,
directions, and satellite imagery through their mobile devices.  Improving the Web.We want to make the web experience as
good as possible for users around the world.This includes providing platforms for developers to build, deploy, and run increasingly rich applications.For users, we are investing in areas to improve their experience in using web-based
applications, including making browsers more stable and powerful.  Products and Services for our Users  Our product development philosophy involves rapid and continuous innovation, with frequent releases of early-stage products that we then iterate and
improve. We often make products available early in their development stages by posting them on Google Labs, at test locations online, or directly on Google.com. If our users find a product useful, we promote it to beta status for
additional testing. Once we are satisfied that a product is of high quality and utility, we remove the beta label and make it a core Google product. Our main products and services are described below.

Google.comSearch and Personalization  We are focused on building products and services on our web sites that benefit our users and let them find relevant information quickly and easily.
These products and services include:  Google Web Search.In addition to providing easy access to billions of web pages, we
have integrated special features into Google Web Search to help people find exactly what they are looking for on the web. The Google.com search experience also includes items like:  
Google Images.Google Images is our searchable index of images found across the web. To extend the usefulness of searching for images, we
offer additional features, such as searching by image size, format, coloration, and image type, such as photos, clipart, faces, and line drawings.  Google Books. Google Books lets users search the full text of a library-sized collection of books to discover books of interest and to learn where to buy or borrow them. Through this program, publishers can
host their content and show their publications in our search results. We also work closely with participating libraries to digitize all or part of their collections to create a full-text searchable online card catalog. Google Books links bring users
to pages containing bibliographic information and several sentences of the search term in context, sample book pages, or full text, depending on author and publisher permissions and book copyright status. To date, we have scanned and indexed over
12million books for search. Last summer we publicly announced our plans to sell our publisher partner's electronic books, or ebooks, in an open platform direct to consumers and through retail and device partners. We plan to launch this
ebook platform in 2010. We are working on obtaining court approval for a settlement agreement reached with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers over lawsuits in
3 
Table of Contents
the U.S. over Google Books. If the court approves this settlement, millions more in-copyright books will be accessible to our users. Many books will be available for purchase even if they are out
of print, expanding the market for authors and publishers to earn money from their works.  Google Scholar.Google Scholar

Google Webmaster Tools. Google Webmaster Tools enables webmasters to understand their
sites' performance in Google's search results. Rich data and diagnostics provide insight into top search queries, site performance, and potential problems such as crawl errors and malware.In turn, higher-quality web sites improve
Google's ability to crawl and index the web and provide more relevant results.  Applications  Information created by a single user becomes much more valuable when shared and combined with information from other people or places. Therefore our
strategy for products we develop in this space is simple: develop tools for our users to create, share, and communicate any information generated by the user, thus making the information more useful and manageable. Examples of products we have
developed with this strategy in mind include:  Google Docs.Google Docs allows our users to create, view, edit, and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations from anywhere using a browser. Consumers and business users value the ability to

The Technology Behind Search and Our User Products and Services  Our web search technology uses a combination of techniques to determine the importance of a web page independent of a particular search query and to
determine the relevance of that page to a particular search query.  Ranking Technology. One element of our technology for ranking
web pages is called PageRank. While we developed much of our ranking technology after Google was formed, PageRank was developed at Stanford University with the involvement of our founders and was therefore published as research. PageRank is a
query-independent technique for determining the importance of web pages by looking at the link structure of the web. PageRank treats a link from web page A to web page B as a vote by page A in favor of page B. The PageRank of a page is
the sum of the pages that link to it. The PageRank of a web page also depends on the importance (or PageRank) of the other web pages casting the votes. Votes cast by important web pages with high PageRank weigh more heavily and are more influential
in deciding the PageRank of pages on the web.  Text-Matching Techniques.Our technology employs text-matching techniques
that compare search queries with the content of web pages to help determine relevance. Our text-based scoring techniques do far more than count the number of times a search term appears on a web page. For example, our technology determines the
proximity of individual search terms to each other on a given web page, and prioritizes results that have the search terms near each other. Many other aspects of a page's content are factored into the equation, as is the content of pages that
link to the page in question. By combining query independent measures such as PageRank with our text-matching techniques, we are able to deliver search results that are relevant to what users are trying to find.  Infrastructure. We provide our products and services using our own software and hardware infrastructure, which provides substantial computing
resources at low cost. We currently use a combination of off-the-shelf and custom software running on clusters of commodity computers. Our considerable investment in developing this infrastructure has produced several benefits. This infrastructure
simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services, and automates much of the administration of large-scale clusters of computers.Although most of this
infrastructure is not directly visible to our users, we believe it is important for providing a high-quality user experience. It enables significant improvements in the relevance of our search and advertising results by allowing us to apply superior
search and retrieval algorithms that are computationally intensive. We believe the infrastructure also shortens our product development cycle and lets us pursue innovation more cost effectively.  How We Provide Value to Our Advertisers and Content Owners  Google AdWords  For advertisers seeking to market their products and services to consumers and business users over the
internet, we offer Google AdWords, an auction-based advertising program that lets advertisers deliver relevant ads targeted to search queries or web content across Google sites and through the web sites of our Google Network, which is the network of
third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content. The Google Network is also increasingly encompassing different forms of media as well, including content providers who use our advertising
programs to deliver ads in online video, television and radio broadcasts. AdWords is accessible to advertisers in 41 different interface languages.

Table of Contents
Advertisers in our AdWords program create text-based or display ads, bid on the keywords that will
trigger the display of their ads and set daily spending budgets. AdWords features an automated online signup process that lets advertisers quickly implement ad campaigns on Google properties and the web sites of our Google Network members. Ads are
ranked for display in AdWords based on a combination of the maximum cost-per-click pricing set by the advertiser and click-through rates and other factors used to determine the relevance of the ads. This favors the ads that are most relevant to
users, improving the experience both for the person looking for information and for the advertiser who is generating relevant ads. The AdWords program offers advertisers the following additional benefits:  Return on Investment.Many advertising dollars are spent delivering messages in an untargeted fashion, and payment for these advertisements
is not tied to performance. AdWords shows ads only to users seeking information related to what the advertisers are selling, and advertisers choose how much they want to pay when a user clicks on their ad. Because we offer a simple ad format,
advertisers can also avoid incurring significant costs associated with creating ads. As a result, even small advertisers find AdWords cost-effective for connecting with potential customers. In addition, advertisers can create many different ads,
increasing the likelihood that an ad is suited to a user's search. Users can find advertisements for what they are seeking, and advertisers can find users who want what they are offering.  Branding.In addition to our cost-per-click pricing model, we also allow advertisers to pay on a cost-per-impression basis on the Google
Network.We also offerPlacement Targeting, a service that lets advertisers target specific web sites with textand displayads, so that they can more effectively reach specific sets of customers. In addition to targeting sites
by content, advertisers can choose placements on sites based on user demographic attributes. To protect user privacy, we use only third-party opt-in panel data to map the demographics of sites in our networks.Placement Targetingis an
auction-based system where placement targetedads compete with keyword-targeted ads in the same auction.   Access to the
Google Search and Content Network. We serve AdWords ads on Google properties, our syndicated search partners' web sites, and themillionsof third-party web sites that make up the GoogleNetwork. As a result, we can offer
extensive search and content inventory on which advertisers can advertise. Apart from keyword-based ads targeted to search queries andPlacement Targeting, we also offer advertisers an effective contextual advertising optionContent
Targetingthat displays their ads on relevant content pages across our network of partner sites and products. As a result, AdWords advertisers can target users on Google properties and on search and content sites across the web. This gives
advertisers increased exposure to users who are likely to be interested in their offerings. The Google Network significantly enhances our ability to attract interested advertisers.  Campaign Control. Google AdWords gives advertisers hands-on control over most elements of their ad campaigns. Advertisers can specify the
relevant search or content topics for each of their ads. Advertisers can also manage expenditures by setting a maximum daily budget and determining how much they are willing to pay whenever a user clicks or views an ad. Other features that make it
easy to set up and manage ad campaigns include:

We offer larger
advertisers additional services that help maximize returns on their internet marketing investments and improve their ability to run large, dynamic campaigns. These include dedicated client service representatives as well as:  
Global Support. We provide customer service to our advertiser base through our global support organization. AdWords is available on a
self-service basis with email and real-time chat support. At certain spending levels and through certain signup channels, phone support is also available. Advertisers with more extensive needs and advertising budgets can request strategic support
services, which include an account team, to help them set up and manage their campaigns. Depending on geography, we accept bank and wire transfers, direct debit, and local debit cards carrying the Visa and MasterCard logos. We also accept payment
through international credit cards. For selected advertisers, we offer several options for credit terms and monthly invoicing. We accept payments in over 40 currencies.  Google AdSense  We are enthusiastic about helping content owners monetize their content, which
facilitates the creation of better content to search. If there is better content on the web, users are likely to do more searches, and we expect that will be good for our business and for users. Our Google AdSense program enables web sites that are
part of the Google Network to deliver AdWords ads that are relevant to the search results or content on their pages. In addition to AdWords, we also surface non-search AdSense inventory (the Content Network) on the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, allowing
certified third party display ad networks to compete with AdWords ads for AdSense inventory.We share most of the revenue generated from ads shown by a Google Network member with that member. The key benefits we offer to Google Network members
include:

Our Google AdSense
program includes:  Google AdSense for Search. For internet companies that want to target search audiences, we offer Google AdSense
for search. To use AdSense for search, most of our AdSense for search partners add Google search functionality to their web pages in the form of customizable Google search boxes. We offer this service free to these partners. When visitors to these
web sites search either the web site or the internet using these customizable search boxes, we display relevant ads (generally text ads) on the search results pages, targeted to match user search queries. These web sites can then generate additional
revenue when visitors click on or view these ads. Because we also offer to license our web search technology along with Google AdSense for search, companies without their own search service can offer Google Web Search to improve the usefulness of
their web sites for their users while increasing their revenue. We generally charge a fee related to these license agreements. We also offer a more customizable premium offering to web sites with significant traffic.  Google AdSense for Content. Google AdSense for content lets web sites generate revenue from advertising by serving relevant AdWords ads
targeted to web content. Web sites can use our automated sign-up process to quickly display AdWords ads on their sites. Under this program, we use automated technology to analyze the meaning of the content on the web site and serve relevant ads
based on the meaning of such content. For example, a web page on an automotive blog that contains an entry about vintage cars might display ads for vintage car parts or vintage car shows. These ads are displayed in spaces that our AdSense for
content partners have set aside on their web sites for our AdWords content. AdSense for content allows a variety of ad types to be shown, including text ads,display ads such asimage adsandvideo ads,andlink units
(which are sets of clickable links to topic pages related to page content). We share the majority of the revenues generated from these ads with the Google Network members that display the ads. Important AdSense for content features include:
Google AdSense for Domains. Google AdSense
for Domains allows owners of undeveloped domains that receive traffic from users typing generic terms into browsers or search to generate revenue from relevant advertising. Google AdSense for Mobile.AdSense for Mobile allows publishers of web sites for mobile phones to generate revenue for their content by
inserting relevant AdWords text and display ads on their web sites.

enables billions of ads to be served each day across the web.Buying and sellingdisplayadvertising is still a very complicated process, and we plan to simplify that process through the evolution of these platforms.  Finally, we recently launched the DoubleClick Ad Exchange to create an open marketplace for the trading ofdisplayad space. This will open
up thedisplayecosystem for participants of all sizes.  The Technology Behind Google's Advertising Programs  Our AdWords and AdSense programs serve millions of relevant, targeted ads each day based on search terms users enter or content they view on the web.
The key elements of our advertising technology include:  Google AdWords Auction System. The Google AdWords auction system lets
advertisers automatically deliver relevant, targeted advertising. Every search query we process involves the automated execution of an auction, resulting in our advertising system often processing hundreds of millions of auctions per day. To
determine whether an ad is relevant to a particular query, this system weighs an advertiser's willingness to pay for prominence in the ad listings (the cost-per-click or cost-per-impression bid) and interest from users in the ad as measured by
the click-through rate and other factors. Our Quality-based bidding system also assigns first page bids to advertiser keywords based on the Quality scores of those keywordsthe higher the Quality score, the lower the first page bid. The Quality
score is determined by an advertiser's keyword click-through rate, the relevance of the ad text, historical keyword performance, the quality of the ad's landing page and other relevancy factors. This prevents advertisers with irrelevant
ads from squatting in top positions to gain exposure, and rewards more relevant, well-targeted ads that are clicked on frequently. Because we are paid only when users click on ads, the AdWords ranking system aligns our interests with
those of our advertisers and our users. The more relevant and useful the ad, the better for our users, for our advertisers and for us.

The AdWords auction system also incorporates the AdWords Discounter, which automatically lowers the
amount advertisers actually pay to the minimum needed to maintain their ad position. Consider a situation where there are three advertisersPat, Betty and Joeeach bidding on the same keyword for ads that will be displayed on Google.com.
These advertisers have ads with equal click-through rates and bid $1.00 per click, $0.60 per click and $0.50 per click, respectively. With our AdWords discounter, Pat would occupy the first ad position and pay only $0.61 per click, Betty would
occupy the second ad position and pay only $0.51 per click, and Joe would occupy the third ad position and pay only $0.01 per click. The AdWords discounter saves money for advertisers by minimizing the price they pay per click, while relieving them
of the need to constantly monitor and adjust their cost-per-click. Advertisers can also experience greater discounts through the application of our smart pricing technology, which can reduce the price of clicks for ads served across the Google
Network based on the expected value of the click to the advertiser.  AdSense Contextual Advertising Technology. Our AdSense
technology employs techniques that consider factors such as keyword analysis, word frequency and the overall link structure of the web to analyze the content of individual web pages and to match ads to them almost instantaneously. With this ad
targeting technology, we can automatically serve contextually relevant ads. To do this, Google Network members embed a small amount of custom HTML code on web pages that generates a request to Google's AdSense service whenever a user views the
web page. Upon receiving a request, our software examines the content of web pages and performs a matching process that identifies advertisements that we believe are relevant to the content of the specific web page. The relevant ads are then
returned to the web pages in response to the request. We employ similar techniques for matching advertisements to other forms of textual content, such as email messages and Google Groups postings. For example, our technology can serve ads offering
tickets to fans of a specific sports team on a news story about that team.  Our display advertising programs provide advertisers and
publishers services related to the delivery of branded display advertising. The key elements of our display advertising technology include:  DoubleClick Advertiser Platform.The DoubleClick Advertiser Platform provides tools for media planning, buying, selling, ad delivery, measurement, and optimization. The key technologies included in this platform are: 
DoubleClick Publisher Platform.The DoubleClick Publisher Platform provides tools that address key
challenges throughout the publisher ad sales cycle and helps maximize the value of publisher content. The key technologies included in this platform are:

intelligence. The key solutions provided by YouTube include:  
Google Enterprise  Schools and businesses continue
moving towards web-based applications and away from licensed software. Since web-based applications require minimal up-front investment, businesses can pay as they use them and receive automatic updates.  Through Google Apps, we provide hosted, web-based applications for businesses, schools, and nonprofit organizations. In addition, we provide our
search technology for use within enterprises through the Google Search Appliance and on their public-facing sites with Google Site Search and Google Commerce Search. Finally, we provide versions of our Google Maps API (hosted) for businesses as well
as Google Earth Enterprise, a behind-the-firewall software solution for imagery and data visualization.  Google Apps. Google Apps
provides hosted communication, collaboration, and security tools for organizations such as businesses, governments, and schools. Google Apps includes messaging features such as Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Talk, and Google Groups collaboration
features such as Google Docs, Google Video, Google Sites, and eDiscovery/Compliance powered by Postini. Google Apps is available in Standard, Education, Partner, and Premier Editions. Postini services are hosted security and archiving solutions for
businesses that work with Google Apps or any mail server.  Google Search Appliance. The Google Search Appliance family of
products serves businesses of all sizes, ranging from small businesses (with the Google Mini) as well as larger organizations and government agencies with the Search Appliance. Some features of the Google Search Appliance include integration with
advanced corporate security protocols, integration with other enterprise applications, such as content management systems, portals and other systems, and real-time search of business applications. The Google Search Appliance is available in three
models, tiered by the quantity of information to be searched: the Google Mini for small business, the GB-7007 for mid-size document counts, and the GB-9009, with the ability to search billions of documents. The appliances search customer-facing web
sites and company-wide intranet applications and support centralized deployments for global business units.  Google Site Search.
The Google Site Search product is based on the popular Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) and offers businesses the performance and quality of Google search for their web site while giving them control of branding, positioning, and API access to
ensure a full and rich integration.  Google Commerce Search. Google Commerce Search is a powerful hosted search solution designed

company firewall or integrated with public systems or the internet.  Sales and Support  We have put significant effort into developing our sales and support infrastructure. We have over 65 offices in over 30 countries, the large majority
of which includes sales people. We deploy specialized sales teams across vertical markets. We bring businesses into our advertising network through both online and direct sales channels. We work to use technology and automation wherever possible to
improve the experience for our advertisers and to grow our business cost-effectively. The vast majority of our advertisers use our automated online AdWords program to establish accounts, create ads, target users, and launch and manage their
advertising campaigns. Our direct advertising sales team focuses on attracting and supporting companies around the world with the largest advertising budgets. Our AdSense program follows a similar model. Most of the web sites in the Google Network
sign up for AdSense using an automated online process. Our direct sales force focuses on building AdSense relationships with leading internet companies. Our display program, which includes DoubleClick and YouTube, also follows a similar model. Most
advertisers and publishers sign up using an automated online process. Our direct sales force focuses on attracting and supporting advertisers and publishers around the world. Our global support organization concentrates on helping our advertisers
and Google Network members get the most out of their relationship with us.  Marketing  We have always believed that building a trusted, highly-recognized brand begins with providing high-quality products and services that make a notable
difference in people's lives. Our user base has grown primarily by word-of-mouth. Our early marketing efforts focused on feeding this word-of-mouth momentum and used public relations efforts to accelerate it. Through these efforts and
people's increased usage of Google worldwide, we have been able to build our brand with relatively low marketing costs as a percentage of our revenues. Today, we use the quality of our own products and services as our most effective marketing
tool, and word-of-mouth momentum continues to drive consumer awareness and user loyalty worldwide. We also engage in targeted marketing efforts, such as those we deliver to our advertising clients, designed to inform potential advertisers, Google
Network members, and enterprises of the benefits they can achieve through Google as well as targeted consumer marketing in certain geographies. In addition, we sponsor industry conferences and have promoted the distribution of Google products to
internet users in order to make our search services easier to access.  Competition  Our business is characterized by rapid change and converging, as well as new and disruptive, technologies. We face formidable competition in every
aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with information on the web and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from:  
15 
Table of Contents
We compete to attract and retain users of our search and communication products and services. Most of the products and services we offer to users are
free, so we do not compete on price. Instead, we compete in this area on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability, and ease of use of our products and services.  Neither our users nor our advertisers are locked in to Google. For users, other search engines are literally one click away, and there are no costs to
switching search engines. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple places, both online and offline. We compete to attract and retain content providers (Google Network members, as well as other content providers for whom we distribute or
license content) primarily based on the size and quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of the agreements.  Intellectual Property  We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws
in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and
consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, and we rigorously control access to proprietary technology.  Google, YouTube, DoubleClick, DART, AdSense, AdWords, Gmail, I'm Feeling Lucky, PageRank, Blogger, orkut, Picasa, SketchUp, and Postini are registered trademarks in the U.S. Our unregistered trademarks include, Blog*Spot, Jaiku,
Android, Open Handset Alliance, OpenSocial, Panoramio, and Knol.  The first version of the PageRank technology was created while Larry
and Sergey attended Stanford University, which owns a patent to PageRank. The PageRank patent expires in 2017. We hold a perpetual license to this patent. In October 2003, we extended our exclusivity period to this patent through 2011, at which
point our license will become non-exclusive.  Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights.
For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.
Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our
intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.

Companies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights,
and trademarks and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property claims against us grows. Our
technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use.  Government Regulation  We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet. In addition, laws
and regulations relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, information security, and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. We face risks from
some of the proposed legislation that could be passed in the future.  In the U.S., laws relating to the liability of providers of online
services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, which include actions for libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark
infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content generated by users. Certain foreign jurisdictions are also testing the liability of providers of online services for
activities of their users and other third parties. Any court ruling that imposes liability on providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business.  A range of other laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing, linking, or hosting third-party content that includes materials that infringe copyrights. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of
materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there
is a security breach for personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply
with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.  Similarly, the application of existing laws prohibiting, regulating, or
requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers, including, for example, online gambling, distribution of pharmaceuticals, adult content, financial services, alcohol, or firearms, can be unclear. Application of these laws in an
unanticipated manner could expose us to substantial liability and restrict our ability to deliver services to our users.  We also face
risks due to government failure to preserve the internet's basic neutrality as to the services and sites that users can access through their broadband service providers. Such a failure to enforce network neutrality could limit the
internet's pace of innovation and the ability of large competitors, small businesses, and entrepreneurs to develop and deliver new products, features, and services, which could harm our business.  We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data, including personal health records. We post on
our web site our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by
governmental authorities or others, which could potentially harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the internet, in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions is unclear and in a state of
flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international
requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to protect our users' privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of
users, which could adversely affect our business.

In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions have claimed
and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure.  Culture and
Employees  We take great pride in our culture. Weembrace collaboration and creativityand encourage the iteration of ideas to
address complex technical challenges.Transparency and open dialog are central to us, and we like to make sure that company news, whether about product launches, industry news and innovations, or organizational changes, reaches our employees
first through internal channels like weekly TGIF meetings, Tech Talks, blogs, and messages from leadership.  We have evolved into a
software, technology, internet, mobile, advertising, and media company all rolled into one.We take technology innovation very seriously and compete aggressively for talent across the globe. We strive to hire the best computer scientists and
engineers to help us solve very significant challenges across systems design, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, networking, software engineering, testing, distributed systems, cluster design, and other areas. We work hard to
provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling jobs and produce technological innovations that have a positive effect on the world through daily use by millions of people.  Despite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup, and we give employees the freedom to act on their ideas regardless of their level
within the company. This spirit has spurred some of our most impactful global initiatives, includingGoogle Flu Trends, which uses search data to estimate global flu activity, GoogleServe, our annual company-wide community service
event,andproducts like Google News, orkut, and Android.  We aim to reflect the globally diverse audience of our products in
our employee population and believe that we can serve our users better when we foster diverse perspectives and ideas within the company.We provide very significant rewards for individuals and teams that provide great value to us, our
advertisers, and our users.The commitment to maintaining and enhancing these programs year after year supports Google's culture of innovation and performance and also keeps employee interests aligned with those of the company. 
At December31, 2009, we had 19,835 employees, consisting of 7,443 in research and development, 7,338 in sales and marketing, 2,941 in general
and administrative and 2,113 in operations. All of Google's employees are also equityholders, with significant collective employee ownership. Seasonality  Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to
continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to
cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.  Available Information  Our web site is located atwww.google.com, and our investor relations web site is located at http://investor.google.com. The following filings are

Risks Related to Our Business
and Industry  We face intense competition.  Our business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and is subject to changing technology, shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We have many competitors in different
industries, including traditional search engines, vertical search engines and e-commerce sites, social networking sites, traditional media companies, and providers of online products and services. Our current and potential competitors range from
large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and end users, and they can use their experience and resources against us in a variety of
competitive ways, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development, and competing aggressively for advertisers and web sites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster
than we can. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and growth rates could decline.  If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and
operating results could suffer.  Our success depends on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful
and enjoyable experience for our users. Our competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising, and web based products and services. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and
development in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then our
users may become dissatisfied and move to a competitor's products and services. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings
experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network members, are not appropriately timed with
market opportunities, or are not effectively brought to market. As search technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer search results that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may
force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.  We generate our revenues
almost entirely from advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.  We
generated 97% of our revenues in both 2008 and 2009 from our advertisers. Our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us
does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver
19 
Table of Contents
their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying
patterns. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would negatively harm our revenues and business.  Our business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users,
advertisers, Google Network members, and other partners.  The brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to
the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Google brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members, and other partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will
increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the internet market. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including service outages, product malfunctions, and data privacy and security issues. If we fail to maintain
and enhance the Google brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely
on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.  We are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.  The growth of our company and
our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Moreover, our competitors have employed and will likely continue to
employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations. Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our
products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, or change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business.  A variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.  We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management
time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies. Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and
related technologies. The laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently
unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have been threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement, or
other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users.  In addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing or linking to third-party web sites that include materials that infringe
copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability
of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California's Information Practices
Act. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.

Acquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful
consequences.  We have acquired a number of businesses in the past, including our acquisitions of DoubleClick and Postini. We expect
to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. In particular, we expect to increase the number of acquisitions we make in 2010 compared to 2009. These transactions could be material to
our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks
include:  
Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or
investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.  Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive
issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may
not materialize. For example, we have yet to realize significant revenue benefits from our acquisition of YouTube.  Our international
operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.  International
revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our total revenues in 2008 and approximately 53% of our total revenues in 2009. More than half of our user traffic came from outside the U.S. in 2009. We have limited experience with operations outside the
U.S. and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:  
21 
Table of Contents
In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing
business in international jurisdictions and could interfere with our ability to offer, or prevent us from offering, our products and services to one or more countries or expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These numerous and sometimes
conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees,
prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will
not violate our policies. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our
ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results.  If our security measures are breached, or if our
services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services,
and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.  Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of
users' and customers' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties,
employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users' or customers' data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or
customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users' or customers' data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation,
and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change
frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception
of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.

Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and
potential users from using our products and services.  From time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products and
services compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation
and operating results. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by
government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.  In addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that
results in the release of our users' data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against
security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web based products and services we offer as well as increase the number of countries where we operate.
Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the
interpretation and application of data protection laws in Europe and elsewhere are still uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in
addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or
require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.  We expect our revenue growth rate to decline and
anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.  We believe our revenue growth rate will generally decline as a
result of a number of factors including increasing competition, the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels, and the increasing maturity of the online advertising market. We believe our operating margin will
experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business. Our operating margin will also experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed
on our Google Network members' web sites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own web sites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Toolbar. The margin
on revenues we generate from our Google Network members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our web sites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network members could
decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network members.  Our operating results
may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.  Our operating
results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of
our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of
these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this Item1A and the following factors may affect our operating results:

Table of Contents
Because our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in
predicting our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid
growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.  Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand. 
Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events
outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are
distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our
ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these
innovations. Changes in patent law, such as changes in the law regarding patentable subject matter, can also impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our innovations. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may
choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed
invalid or unenforceable.  We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word
Google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word Google to refer
to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.  
24 
Table of Contents
We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be
compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.  We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.  Companies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently
enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase. Our products, services,
and technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims and regardless of the merits of the claim, intellectual property claims are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us
are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue any of our services or practices that are found to be in violation of another party's rights.  We also may have to seek a license to continue such practices, which may significantly increase our operating expenses. In addition, many of our
agreements with our Google Network members and other partners require us to indemnify these members for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may
require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims.  Companies have filed trademark infringement and related
claims against us over the display of ads in response to user queries that include trademark terms. The outcomes of these lawsuits have differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We currently have three cases pending at the European Court of
Justice, which will address questions regarding whether advertisers and search engines can be held liable for use of trademarked terms in keyword advertising. We are litigating, or have recently litigated similar issues in other cases, in the U.S.,
Australia, Austria, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.  We have also had copyright
claims filed against us by companies alleging that features of certain of our products and services, including Google Web Search, Google News, Google Video, Google Image Search, Google Book Search, and YouTube, infringe the rights of others. In the
U.S. we announced a settlement with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers. However, this class action settlement is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and we may be subject to
additional claims with respect to Google Book Search both in the U.S. and in other parts of the world. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing
us from offering certain functionalities, and may also result in a change in our business practices, which could result in a loss of revenues for us or otherwise harm our business. In addition, any time one of our products or services links to or
hosts material in which others allegedly own copyrights, we face the risk of being sued for copyright infringement or related claims. Because these products and services comprise the majority of our products and services, the risk of harm from such
lawsuits could be substantial.  We have also had patent lawsuits filed against us alleging that certain of our products and services,
including Android, Google Web Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Google Talk, and Google Chrome, infringe patents held by others. In addition, the number of demands for license fees and the dollar amounts associated with each request continue
to increase. Adverse results in these lawsuits, or our decision to license patents based upon these demands, may result in substantial costs and, in the case of adverse litigation rulings, could prevent us from offering certain features,
functionalities, products, or services, which could result in a loss of revenues for us or otherwise harm our business.

More individuals are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet. If users
of these devices do not widely adopt versions of our web search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.  The number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile telephones, personal digital assistants
(PDAs), smart phones, handheld computers, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality, and memory associated with some alternative devices make the use of
our products and services through such devices more difficult and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or
distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. We have limited experience to date in operating versions of our products and services
developed or optimized for users of alternative devices, such as Google Mobile and Android, or in designing and selling alternative devices, such as the Nexus One. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to
predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such devices. If we are
unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices, we
will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business.  New technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.  Technologies have been
developed that can block the display of our ads. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages. As a result, ad-blocking technology could adversely affect our operating
results.  If we fail to detect click fraud or other invalid clicks, we could lose the confidence of our advertisers, which would
cause our business to suffer.  We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks and other invalid clicks on our ads from a variety of
potential sources. We have regularly refunded fees that our advertisers have paid to us that were later attributed to click fraud and other invalid clicks, and we expect to do so in the future. Invalid clicks are clicks that we have determined are
not intended by the user to link to the underlying content, such as inadvertent clicks on the same ad twice and clicks resulting from click fraud. Click fraud occurs when a user intentionally clicks on a Google AdWords ad displayed on a web site for
a reason other than to view the underlying content. While we have implemented systems to identify and reduce fraudulent and invalid clicks, an increase in refunds could negatively affect our profitability and damage our brand.  Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and
services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.  The availability of our products and services depends on
the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses,
computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of
vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a
natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and
services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Any
26 
Table of Contents
errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and
damage our brand.  Index spammers could harm the integrity of our web search results, which could damage our reputation and cause our
users to be dissatisfied with our products and services.  There is an ongoing and increasing effort by index spammers to
develop ways to manipulate our web search results. For example, because our web search technology ranks a web page's relevance based in part on the importance of the web sites that link to it, people have attempted to link a group of web sites
together to manipulate web search results. We take this problem very seriously because providing relevant information to users is critical to our success. If our efforts to combat these and other types of index spamming are unsuccessful, our
reputation for delivering relevant information could be diminished. This could result in a decline in user traffic, which would damage our business.  Our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.  We have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management,
operational, and financial infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and operating results. Our expansion and growth in international
markets heighten these risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems, and commercial
infrastructures. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures. These systems enhancements and improvements will require
significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position.  We rely on our Google Network members for a significant portion of our revenues, and we benefit from our association with them. The loss of these members could adversely affect our business.  We provide advertising, web search, and other services to our Google Network members, which accounted for 31% of our revenues in 2008 and 30% of our
revenues in 2009. Some of the participants in this network may compete with us in one or more areas. They may decide in the future to terminate their agreements with us. If our Google Network members decide to use a competitor's or their own
web search or advertising services, our revenues would decline. Our agreements with a few of the largest Google Network members account for a significant portion of revenues derived from our AdSense program. If our relationship with one or more
large Google Network members were terminated or renegotiated on terms less favorable to us, our business could be adversely affected.  Also, certain of our key Google Network members operate high-profile web sites, and we derive tangible and intangible benefits from this affiliation. If one or more of these key relationships is terminated or not renewed, and is not
replaced with a comparable relationship, our business would be adversely affected.  If we were to lose the services of Eric, Larry,
Sergey, or other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.  Our future success
depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, our CEO, Eric Schmidt, and our founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are critical to the overall management of Google as well as the
development of our technology, our culture, and our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of any of our management or key
personnel could seriously harm our business.  
27 
Table of Contents
We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire
qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.  Our performance largely depends on
the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for
qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and
retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.  In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to
implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.  Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to block,
degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.  Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies
that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, and mobile communications companies. Some of these providers have stated that they may take
measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our
users to provide our offerings. While interference with access to our popular products and services seems unlikely, such carrier interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers and increased costs, and could impair our ability
to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.  To the extent our revenues are paid in foreign
currencies, and currency exchange rates become unfavorable, we may lose some of the economic value of the revenues in U.S. dollar terms.  As we expand our international operations, more of our customers may pay us in foreign currencies. Since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. For instance, if currency exchange rates were to change unfavorably, the U.S. dollar equivalent of our operating income recorded in foreign currencies would be diminished. Hedging strategies, such as forward
contracts, options, and foreign exchange swaps that we have implemented or may implement to mitigate this risk may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Additionally, hedging programs expose us to risks that
could adversely affect our financial results, including the following:  
28 
Table of Contents
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.  Our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have
higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations
thereof. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the
determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates
are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.  Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock  The
trading price for our ClassA common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.  The trading price of our ClassA
common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering and will likely continue to be volatile. For example, in 2009, the price of our ClassA common stock ranged from $282.75 per share to $625.99 per share. The trading price of our
ClassA common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:  
In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in
particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our
ClassA common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been
instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.

We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.  We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any
dividends in the foreseeable future.  The concentration of our capital stock ownership with our founders, executive officers, and our
directors and their affiliates will limit our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.  Our Class B common stock
has 10 votes per share and our ClassA common stock has one vote per share. As of December31, 2009, our founders, executive officers, and directors (and their affiliates) together owned shares of ClassA common stock, Class B common
stock, and other equity interests representing approximately 70% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. In particular, as of December31, 2009, our two founders and our CEO, Larry, Sergey, and Eric, owned approximately 90% of our
outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 68% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring
stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control limits our stockholders'
ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our ClassA common stock could be adversely affected.  Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.  Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our
management. These provisions include the following:  
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a
business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware
law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.

From time to time, we are
involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax,
and other matters. Although claims, suits, investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of our current pending matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. In
addition, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. See the risk factors
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand and We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights
claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future in Item1A of this Annual Report on Form10-K.  EPA Investigation  In February 2009, we learned
of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller data facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We are cooperating
with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials. The EPA investigation could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other administrative action.  While we currently believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, we have noted it in accord with SEC regulations
that call for disclosure of certain environmental proceedings that may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.  
No matters were submitted to a vote of our security holders during the fourth quarter of 2009.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview  Google is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. Our innovations in web search and advertising have
made our web site a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. We serve three primary constituencies:
How We Generate Revenue  Advertising revenues made up 99% of our revenues in 2007 and 97% of our revenues in 2008 and 2009. We derive most of our additional revenues from
offering display advertising management services to advertisers, ad agencies, and publishers, as well as licensing our enterprise products, search solutions, and web search technology.  Google AdWords is our automated online program that enables advertisers to place targeted text-based and display ads on our web sites and our Google
Network members' web sites. Display advertising typically includes static or animated images as well as interactive audio or video media, such as the banner ads on the tops or sides of many popular web sites.Most of our AdWords customers
pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear
on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites as specified by the advertiser. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-click pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads
that appears next to the search results on our web sites or next to the search results or content on our Google Network
37 
Table of Contents
members' web sites. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time their ads are displayed on our web sites or
the Google Network members' web sites. Our AdWords agreements are generally terminable at any time by our advertisers.  Google
AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers' AdWords ads for display on the web sites of our Google Network members as well as programs to deliver ads on television. Our AdSense programs include AdSense for
search and AdSense for content.  AdSense for search is our online service for distributing relevant ads from our advertisers for display
with search results on our Google Network members' sites. To use AdSense for search, most of our AdSense for search partners add Google search functionality to their web pages in the form of customizable Google search boxes. When visitors of
these web sites search either the web site or the internet using these customizable search boxes, we display relevant ads on the search results pages, targeted to match user search queries. Ads shown through AdSense for search are text ads.
AdSense for content is our online service for distributing ads from our advertisers that are relevant to content on our Google Network
members' web sites. Under this program, we use automated technology to analyze the meaning of the content on the web page and serve relevant ads based on the meaning of such content. For example, a web page on an automotive blog that contains
an entry about vintage cars might display ads for vintage car parts or vintage car shows. These ads are displayed in spaces that our AdSense for content partners have set aside on their web sites. AdSense for content allows a variety of ad types to
be shown, including text ads, image ads, Google Video Ads, link units (which are sets of clickable links to topic pages related to page content), themed units (which are regular text ads with graphic treatments that change seasonally and by
geography), and gadget ads (which are customized mini-sites that run as ads on AdSense publisher web sites).  For our online
AdSense program, our advertisers pay us a fee each time a user clicks on one of our advertisers' ads displayed on our Google Network members' web sites or, for those advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as their ads are
displayed. To date, we have paid most of these advertiser fees to our Google Network members, and we expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the portion of the advertiser fee we pay
to our Google Network members as traffic acquisition costs under cost of revenues. In some cases, we guarantee our Google Network members minimum revenue share payments based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search
queries or advertisements displayed. Google Network members do not pay any fees associated with the use of our AdSense program on their web sites.  Our agreements with Google Network members consist largely of uniform online click-wrap agreements that members enter into by interacting with our registration web sites. The standard agreements have no
stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements contain provisions requiring us to share with the Google Network member most of the
advertiser fees generated by users clicking on ads on the Google Network member's web site or, for advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as the ads are displayed on the Google Network member's web site.  Google TV Ads enable advertisers, operators, and programmers to buy, schedule, deliver, and measure ads on television. We recognize as revenue the
fees charged advertisers each time an ad is displayed on television.  We also offer display advertising management services such as
media planning, buying, implementation, and measurement tools for advertisers and agencies and forecasting and reporting tools for publishers. We recognize the related fees as licensing and other revenues in the period advertising impressions are
delivered.  In January 2010, we launched our mobile phone business. We will recognize fees derived from the sale of mobile phones as
licensing and other revenues in the period in which the mobile phones are delivered.

We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license
their video and other content. Our agreements with content providers are typically standard agreements with no stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and
the negotiated agreements contain provisions requiring us to pay the content providers for the content we license. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites from
which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers and Google Network members. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue. We recognize the portion of the advertiser fees we pay to our content
providers as content acquisition costs under cost of revenues and the portion we pay to our Google Network members as traffic acquisition costs. In some cases, we guarantee our content providers minimum revenue share or other payments. 
We believe the factors that influence the success of our advertising programs include the following:  
Trends in Our Business  Our business has grown rapidly since inception, resulting in substantially increased revenues, and we expect that our business will continue to grow. However, our revenue growth rate has generally declined over
time, and we expect it will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition, the difficulty of maintaining growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels and increasing maturity of the online advertising
market in certain countries. In addition, weak economic conditions have generally adversely impacted our revenue growth rate and may result in fewer commercial queries by our users and may cause advertisers to reduce the amount they spend on online
advertising, including the amount they are willing to pay for each click or impression, which could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues. Further, a slow or uneven pace of economic recovery could also negatively affect the growth rate
of our revenues.  The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to our users, reflecting our
commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites. These steps include not
displaying ads that generate low click-through rates or that send users to irrelevant or otherwise low quality sites and terminating our relationships with those Google Network members whose web sites do not meet our quality requirements. We may
also continue to take steps to reduce the number of accidental clicks by our users. These steps could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues.

Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are
likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely
continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenues, as well as paid click and average cost-per-click growth rates.  The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our Google Network members' web sites through our AdSense program is significantly lower than the operating margin we realize from
revenues generated from ads placed on our web sites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network members' web sites are shared with our Google Network members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues
from our web sites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network members' web sites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future, although the relative
rate of growth in revenues from our web sites compared to the rate of growth in revenues from our Google Network members' web sites may vary over time.  We continue to invest in building the necessary employee and systems infrastructures required to manage our growth and develop and promote our products and services, and this may cause our operating margins to
decrease. We have generally experienced and expect to continue to experience growth in our operations as we build our research and development programs, expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members, and content providers, and
increase our presence in international markets. Also, we have acquired and expect to continue to acquire businesses and other assets from time to time. In particular, we expect to increase the number of acquisitions we make in 2010 compared to 2009.
These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings. Our full-time employee headcount was 20,222 at December31, 2008 and 19,835 at
December31, 2009. In the past few quarters, we made efforts to improve the discipline of our hiring process and to focus on better managing our expense growth. However, we expect to continue to invest in our business, including significantly
increasing our hiring rate, and this may cause our operating margins to decrease.  We expect our cost of revenues will increase in
dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, and credit card and other transaction fees, content acquisition costs, and other
costs, including the costs of the mobile phones that we sell. In particular, traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may increase in the future if we are unable to continue to improve the monetization or generation of
revenues from traffic on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites, including with those members to whom we have guaranteed minimum revenue share payments.  Our international revenues have grown as a percentage of our total revenues from 51% 2008 to 53% in 2009. This increase in the portion of our revenues
derived from international markets results largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs, and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products in these international markets. The increase in the proportion of
international revenues derived from international markets continues to increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. For example, in 2009, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign
currencies (primarily the Euro and the British pound) had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. We have a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies. However, this program
will not fully offset the effect of fluctuations on our revenues and earnings.  Recent Development  In January 2010, we announced our decision to review our business operations in China and that we are discussing with the Chinese government the basis
on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine pursuant to local law. These discussions may result in our shutting down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China. The ultimate outcome, including any related exit costs we might incur, is
unknown at this time.

Growth in our revenues from 2008 to 2009 resulted primarily from growth in advertising revenues
generated by Google web sites, and to a lesser extent, Google Network members' web sites. Our advertising revenue growth for Google web sites and Google Network members' web sites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid
clicks through our advertising programs, partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. In addition, the growth in advertising revenues benefited from more hedging gains recognized under our foreign exchange
risk management program. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements, and the continued global expansion of our products, our
advertiser base and our user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network members. The decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was primarily the result of the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative
to foreign currencies (primarily the British pound and the Euro), as well as changes in geographical mix due to traffic growth in emerging markets, where average cost-per-clicks are typically lower, compared to more mature markets. In addition, the
decrease in the average cost-per-click was due to changes in how we believe advertisers managed their advertising costs in response to the uncertain economic conditions. Specifically, we believe that, as a result of the economic downturn and
continuing economic uncertainty, advertisers, in aggregate, lowered their bids for keywords in response to a decrease in sales they were able to make per paid click.  Growth in our revenues from 2007 to 2008 resulted primarily from growth in advertising revenues for Google web sites, and to a lesser extent, Google Network members' web sites. Our advertising revenue growth
for Google web sites and Google Network members' web sites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our
advertisers. In addition, the growth in advertising revenues benefited from hedging gains recognized under our foreign exchange risk management program in 2008. We recognized no such gains in 2007. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated
through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements, and the continued global expansion of our products, our advertiser base and our user base, as well as an increase in the number of
Google Network members. The increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was partially the result of the general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and the Japanese yen).  Improvements in our ability to ultimately monetize increased traffic primarily relate to enhancing the end user experience, including providing end
users with ads that are more relevant to their search queries or to the content on the Google Network members' web sites they visit. For instance, these improvements include, providing end users with multiple site links for certain web search
results, reducing the minimum cost-per-click resulting in the display of more relevant ads, changing the formula used to determine which ads appear at the top of our search results pages, and changing the clickable area around our AdSense for
content text-based ads to only the title and URL to reduce the number of accidental clicks. In addition, we have further enhanced the accuracy of our quality scoring, which is our measurement of an ad's click-through rate and other relevancy
factors.  Aggregate paid clicks on Google web sites and Google Network members' web sites increased approximately 15% from 2008 to
2009 and approximately 18% from 2007 to 2008. Average cost-per-click on Google web sites and Google Network members' web sites decreased approximately 7% from 2008 to 2009 and increased approximately 7% from 2007 to 2008. The rate of change in
aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click, and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors including the revenue growth rates on our web sites compared to
those of our Google Network members, advertiser competition for keywords, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, seasonality, the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs, and general economic
conditions. In addition, traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals also contributes to these fluctuations. Changes in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click may not be
indicative of our performance or advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry.  We believe that the
increase in the number of paid clicks on Google web sites and Google Network members' web sites is substantially the result of our commitment to improving the relevance and quality of both our search results and the advertisements displayed,
which we believe results in a better user experience, which in turn results in more searches, advertisers, and Google Network members and other partners.

Revenues by Geography  Domestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our advertisers, are set forth below.  
The growth in international revenues (other than the United Kingdom) as a percentage of
consolidated revenues from 2008 to 2009 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets, partially offset by the net
effect of the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) and the related hedging gains.  The decrease in revenues from the United Kingdom as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2008 to 2009 resulted largely from the effect of the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the British pound, partially offset by
more hedging gains realized from our foreign exchange risk management program in 2009 as compared to 2008.  The general strengthening of
the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the British pound and the Euro) from 2008 to 2009 had an unfavorable impact on our international revenues (international revenues increased $1,297.0million during this period). Had
foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our total revenues would have been approximately $1.03billion, or 4.3%, higher in 2009. This is before consideration of hedging gains recognized to revenues of $167.8million and
$324.7 million in 2008 and 2009.  The growth in international revenues from 2007 to 2008 resulted largely from increased acceptance of
our advertising programs and increases in our direct sales resources and customer support operations in international markets, our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets, the favorable
effect of the general weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and the Japanese yen) as well as hedging gains realized in 2008 from our foreign exchange risk management program. We recognized no such gains in
2007.  Although we expect to continue to invest in international markets, these investments may not result in an increase in our
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2010 or thereafter. See Note15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about geographic
areas.  Costs and Expenses  Cost of
Revenues  Cost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately
paid to our Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to
our web site (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share arrangements with our Google Network members and distribution partners.  Certain AdSense agreements obligate us to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google Network members based on their achieving defined
performance terms, such as number of search queries or
43 
Table of Contents
advertisements displayed. These fees may be paid in advance or in arrears and are non-refundable but are subject to adjustment based on the achievement of the defined performance terms. In
addition, the arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our Google Network members may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. To the extent we expect revenues generated under an
arrangement to exceed the guaranteed minimum revenue share payments, we recognize traffic acquisition costs on a contractual revenue share basis or on a basis proportionate to forecasted revenues, whichever is greater. Otherwise, we recognize the
guaranteed revenue share payments as traffic acquisition costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the related agreements. For AdSense agreements under which we only pay on a contractual revenue share basis, we recognize the revenue share
obligations as traffic acquisition costs at the same time we recognize the related revenue. Also, concurrent with the commencement of a small number of AdSense and other agreements, we have purchased certain items from, or provided other
consideration to, our Google Network members and partners. We have determined that certain of these amounts are prepaid traffic acquisition costs and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related agreements.  In addition, certain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusivelyor at
allbased on revenue share. The fees are non-refundable. Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts, we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early
termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any
contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, we expense the fees as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues.  Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy and bandwidth
costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we
distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements we display ads on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads
generate with the content providers and the Google Network members. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share or other payments to our content providers, we recognize content acquisition costs equal to the greater of
the following three amounts: 1) the contractual revenue share amount, if any, 2) an amount that is based on the number of times the content is displayed, or 3) an amount calculated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the agreements. The
following tables present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and our traffic acquisition costs and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):
44 
Table of Contents
Cost of revenues increased $222.6 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase was primarily related to an
increase in traffic acquisition costs of $249.1 million from our distribution arrangements as a result of more distribution fees paid and more traffic directed to our web sites. This was partially offset by a decrease in traffic acquisition costs of
$18.7 million from our AdSense arrangements primarily as a result of more revenue realized from Google Network members to whom we paid less revenue share. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was
primarily due to an increase in the proportion of advertising revenues from our web sites compared to our Google Network members' web sites, as well as more revenue realized from Google Network members to whom we paid less revenue share.
Cost of revenues increased $1,972.4 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase was primarily related to an increase in traffic acquisition
costs of $1,005.1 million primarily resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The increase was also related to an increase of $675.2 million in data center costs primarily resulting from the depreciation of
additional information technology assets and data center buildings as well as additional labor required to manage the data centers. In addition, there was an increase in the amortization of developed technology of $133.0 million resulting primarily
from our DoubleClick acquisition, and an increase in expenses related to acquiring content on our web sites of $106.0 million. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the
proportion of advertising revenues coming from our web sites rather than from our Google Network members' web sites.  We expect
cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2010 and in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, credit card and other
transaction fees, content acquisition, and other costs, including the costs of the mobile phones that we sell. Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, including the
following:  
Research and Development  The
following table presents our research and development expenses, and research and development expenses as a percentage of our revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):  
Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for
personnel responsible for the research and development of new products and services, as well as significant improvements to existing products and services. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.  
45 
Table of Contents
Research and development expenses increased $49.8 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in labor related costs of $138.3million largely as a result of a 14% increase in research and development headcount, partially offset by a decrease in professional services costs of $73.8 million, the majority of
which were related to consulting costs, and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $22.6 million as certain intangible assets have been fully amortized.  Research and development expenses increased $673.2 million from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities related costs of $387.1million as a result of a 25%
increase in research and development headcount. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $162.6 million.  We expect that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2010 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and systems
infrastructures required to support the development of new, and improve existing, products and services.  Sales and Marketing 
The following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues for the
periods presented (dollars in millions):  
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel
engaged in customer service and sales and sales support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenditures.  Sales and
marketing expenses increased $37.7 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expense of $104.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in travel, conference and related expenses of $49.8
million.  Sales and marketing expenses increased $484.9 million from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in
labor and facilities related costs of $373.1 million mostly as a result of a 20% increase in sales and marketing headcount. In addition, stock-based compensation expense increased $74.4 million.  We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2010 and future periods
as we expand our business on a worldwide basis.  General and Administrative  The following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the
periods presented (dollars in millions):  
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for
personnel and facilities related to our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information
technology consulting, and outsourcing services.  
46 
Table of Contents
General and administrative expenses decreased $135.3 million from 2008 to 2009. This decrease was
primarily related to the settlement agreement with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers (AAP) under which we recognized $95.1 million of expense in 2008. In addition, consulting costs decreased $59.6 million.  General and administrative expenses increased $523.3 million from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily related to an increase in professional
services of $243.0 million, the majority of which were related to legal costs, including the aforementioned legal settlement with the Authors Guild and the AAP. In addition, there was an increase in labor and facilities related costs of $137.8
million, primarily as a result of a 9% increase in general administrative headcount from 2007 to 2008, and an increase in bad debt expense of $96.1 million due to the general economic downturn.  Stock-Based Compensation  The
following table presents our stock-based compensation and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):  
In March 2009, we completed an offer to
exchange certain employee stock options issued under Google's 2004 Stock Plan (the Exchange). Certain previously granted options were exchanged for new stock options with a lower exercise price granted on a one-for-one basis. Options for an
aggregate of approximately 7.6million shares of Google's ClassA common stock were exchanged. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have an exercise price of $308.57 per share, the closing price of Google's ClassA
common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March6, 2009. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have a new vesting schedule determined by adding 12 months to each vesting date under the exchanged options' original
vesting schedule. In addition, new options will vest no sooner than six months after the date of the Exchange. The Exchange resulted in a modification charge of approximately $360 million which is being recognized over the vesting periods of the new
options. These vesting periods range from six months to approximately five years. We recorded approximately $103 million of the modification charge in 2009.  Stock-based compensation increased $44.3 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was largely due to the modification charge recognized in 2009, as well as additional stock awards issued to existing and new
employees. This increase was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense as a result of a significant amount of equity awards which fully vested in 2008, as well as an increase to the overall estimated forfeiture rate.  Stock-based compensation increased $251.2 million from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily due to additional stock awards issued to existing and
new employees.  Impairment of Equity Investments  In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.09 billion, which was primarily comprised of $726.0 million and $355.0 million related to our investments in America Online, Inc. (AOL) and Clearwire Corporation
(Clearwire). We subsequently sold our investment in AOL in the second quarter of 2009. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Interest Income and Other, Net  Interest income and
other, net decreased $247.4 million from 2008 to 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income of $159.9 million due to lower yields on our cash and investment balances and an increase in net foreign exchange related
costs of $87.9 million primarily due to more hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program.  
47 
Table of Contents
Interest income and other, net decreased $273.2 million from 2007 to 2008. This decrease was primarily
driven by an increase in net foreign exchange related costs of $155.7 million primarily due to more hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program, and a decrease in interest income of $169.7 million due to lower yields on our
cash and investment balances. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in realized gains on sales of marketable securities of $43.0 million.  The costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities that we recognized to interest income and other, net are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related
duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts as well as the volatility of the foreign exchange rates.  As we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in dollar amount in 2010 and future periods.  Provision for Income Taxes  The following table
presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions):  
Our provision for income taxes increased from
2008 to 2009, primarily as a result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year.Our effective tax rate decreased from 2008 to 2009, primarily as a result of the amount of the impairment charge
of equity investments recorded in 2008 compared to the related benefit.  Our provision for income taxes increased from 2007 to 2008,
primarily as a result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year.Our effective tax rate increased from 2007 to 2008, primarily as a result of the amount of the impairment charge of equity
investments compared to the related benefit, and due to greater net gains recognized on hedges of certain intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program in a legal entity where we have a higher statutory tax
rate and greater net losses recognized on the related hedged transactions in legal entities where we have lower statutory tax rates, partially offset by proportionately higher earnings in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates.
Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are
lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal
entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations,
accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes
resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.  See Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our provision for income taxes.  A
reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Quarterly Results of Operations  You should read the following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form
10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. You should also keep in mind, as you read the following tables, that our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily
indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.  The following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of
operations for the eight quarters ended December31, 2009. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for fair presentation of our financial position and operating results
for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial
queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

The following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues
for the eight quarters ended December31, 2009.  
Liquidity and Capital Resources  In summary, our cash flows are as follows (in millions):  
At December31, 2009 we had $24.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable
securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market
mutual funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K describes further the composition of our cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities.  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the
cash flow that we generate from our operations. At December31, 2008 and 2009, we had unused letters of credit for approximately $109.9 million and $101.2 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and
cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. Also, if
the banking system or the financial markets further deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected. In addition, we may make acquisitions or
license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund any such acquisitions and licensing activities. Additional
financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us. During the second half of 2009, we entered into agreements to acquire On2 Technologies, Inc. (On2) and AdMob, Inc. (AdMob). In the first quarter of 2010, we entered into an amendment
to our agreement to acquire On2 pursuant to which we agreed to increase the consideration payable to On2 stockholders. The aggregate consideration payable to On2 stockholders is approximately $124million in stock and cash based on the
50

closing price of our Class A common stock on February10, 2010. The aggregate consideration payable to AdMob stockholders is $750million in stock. The completion of these transactions
is subject to customary closing conditions, and stockholder approval for On2. We expect On2 to close in the first quarter of 2010 and AdMob to close in the first half of 2010.  Cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, stock-based
compensation expense, excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities, deferred income taxes, and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was $9,316.2 million and consisted
of net income of $6,520.4 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $2,309.8 million and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $486.0 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,240.0 million of depreciation
and amortization expense on property and equipment, $1,164.1 million of stock-based compensation expense and $284.3 million of amortization of intangibles and other, partially offset by $268.1 million of deferred income taxes on earnings and $90.3
million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a decrease of $262.0 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets, an increase in accrued
expenses and other liabilities of $243.1 million which is a direct result of the growth of our business, and a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $217.5 million, which includes the same $90.3 million of excess tax
benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in accrued revenue share of $157.7 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase of $504.0 million in accounts receivable due
to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers. The increase in net income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by an increase in the amount of estimated income taxes
we paid during the year. The increase in accrued revenue share was due to the growth in our AdSense and distribution programs and the timing of payments made to our partners.  Cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was $7,852.9 million and consisted of net income of $4,226.9 million, adjustments for non-cash items of
$3,298.8 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $327.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,212.2 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $1,119.8
million of stock-based compensation expense, and $1,094.8 million of impairment charges of equity investments, partially offset by $224.6 million of deferred income taxes on earnings and $159.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award
activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $626.0 million, which includes the same $159.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based
award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $338.9 million. The increases in accrued expenses are a direct result of the growth of our business and an increase in
headcount. These increases to working capital activities were partially offset by an increase of $334.5 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers, a decrease of $211.5 million in accounts payable due to the
timing of invoice processing and payments and an increase of $147.1 million in prepaid revenue shares, expenses, and other assets.  Cash
provided by operating activities in 2007 was $5,775.4 million and consisted of net income of $4,203.7 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $1,253.1 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $318.6 million.
Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $868.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $807.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, partially offset by $379.2 million of excess tax benefits
from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $744.8 million, which includes the same $379.2 million of excess tax
benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $418.9 million, an increase in accrued revenue share of $150.3 million, an increase in accounts
payable of $70.1 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $70.3 million. The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses are a direct result of the growth of our business and an increase in headcount. These increases to working capital
activities were partially offset by an increase of $837.2 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers and an increase of $298.7 million in prepaid revenue shares, expenses, and other assets.

As we expand our business internationally, we have offered payment terms to certain advertisers that
are standard in their locales, but longer than terms we would generally offer to our domestic advertisers. This may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative effect on cash provided by our operating activities. Also, as a
result of our decision to review our business operations in China, we may incur exit costs related to the potential shut down of Google.cn and our China offices.  Cash used in investing activities in 2009 of $8,019.2 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $7,036.2 million and capital expenditures of $809.9 million.  Cash used in investing activities in 2008 of $5,319.4 million was primarily attributable to cash consideration used in acquisitions and other
investments of $3,367.5 million primarily related to the acquisition of DoubleClick and capital expenditures of $2,358.5 million, partially offset by net maturities and sales of marketable securities of $406.5 million including our investment in
Clearwire.  Cash used in investing activities in 2007 of $3,681.6 million was attributable to capital expenditures of $2,402.8 million,
cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $941.2 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Postini, and net purchases of marketable securities of $337.6 million.  Capital expenditures are mainly for the purchase of information technology assets. In order to manage expected increases in internet traffic,
advertising transactions, and new products and services, and to support our overall global business expansion, we will make significant investments in data center operations, technology, corporate facilities, and information technology
infrastructure in 2010 and thereafter. However, the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.  In addition, we expect to spend a significant amount of cash on acquisitions and other investments from time to time. In particular, we expect to increase the number of acquisitions we make in 2010 compared to
2009. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies and our product offerings. In connection with certain acquisitions, we are obligated to make additional
cash payments if certain criteria are met. As of December31, 2009, the remaining contingent obligation amount related to these acquisitions was approximately $35 million, which if the criteria are met, would be recorded as part of the
purchase. Since these contingent payments are based on the achievement of performance targets, actual payments may be substantially lower.  Cash provided by financing activities in 2009 of $233.4 million was primarily due to net proceeds related to stock-based award activities of $143.1 million. Net proceeds result when the cash we receive upon the exercise of stock options
exceeds the tax withholding payments we make on behalf of our employees upon the net settlement of their vested restricted stock units. In addition, there were excess tax benefits of $90.3 million from stock-based award activities during the period
which represented a portion of the $260.2 million reduction to income taxes payable that we recorded in 2009 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale, or vesting of these awards.  Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 of $87.6 million was due primarily to excess tax benefits of $159.1 million from stock-based award
activities during the period which represents a portion of the $250.9 million reduction to income tax payable that we recorded in 2008 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale, or vesting of these awards, partially
offset by net payments related to stock-based award activities of $71.5 million.  Cash provided by financing activities in 2007 of
$403.1 million was due primarily toexcess tax benefits of $379.2 million from stock-based award activities during the period and net proceeds related to stock-based award activities of $23.9 million.

Contractual Obligations as of December31, 2009  
The above table does not include contingent consideration that may be paid pursuant to asset
purchases or business combinations. It also does not include payments related to toolbar and other product distribution arrangements as those arrangements do not include guaranteed obligations.  Operating Leases  We have
entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring between 2010 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the related
operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table above. Certain of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such leases on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  Purchase Obligations  Purchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations at December31, 2009. In addition, we had $1.9 billion of open purchase
orders for which we have not received the related services or goods at December31, 2009. This amount is not included in the above table because we have the right to cancel the purchase orders prior to the date of delivery. The majority of our
non-cancelable contractual obligations are related to data center operations and facility build-outs.  Other Long-Term Liabilities
Other long-term liabilities consist of cash obligations, primarily the legal settlement with the Authors Guild and the AAP and
milestone and royalty payments owed in connection with certain acquisitions and licensing agreements.  In addition, we recognized
additional long-term taxes payable of $496.5 million in the year ended December31, 2009 related to tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate
of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the table above.  Guaranteed Minimum Revenue Share Payments  In connection with our AdSense revenue share agreements, we are periodically required to make non-cancelable guaranteed minimum payments to a small number of our Google Network members over the term of the
respective contracts. Under our contracts, these guaranteed payments may be adjusted downward based on our Google Network members not achieving defined performance targets, such as number of advertisements displayed or search queries. We believe the
amounts included in the table above represent a reasonable estimate of the future minimum guaranteed payments. Actual guaranteed payments may differ from the estimates. To date, the aggregate advertiser fees generated under these AdSense agreements
have exceeded the aggregate guaranteed minimum revenue share payments.  
53 
Table of Contents
At December31, 2009, our aggregate outstanding non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share
commitments totaled $133.3 million through 2012 compared to $1,030.3million at December31, 2008.  Off-Balance Sheet Entities  At December31, 2009, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to
investors.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting
estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial
condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting
estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.  Income Taxes  We are subject to
income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.  Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters
will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the
amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered
appropriate, as well as the related net interest.  Our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the
tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes, certain benefits realized related to stock option activities, and research and experimentation tax credits. The effective tax rates were 25.9%, 27.8%, and 22.2% for 2007, 2008, and 2009. Our future
effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses
recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws,
regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of
adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.  Stock-Based
Compensation  Our stock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair value as calculated
by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the
54 
Table of Contents
requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change
significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected
to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.  Impairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities  We periodically review our marketable securities, as well as our non-marketable equity securities, for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is
other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is
more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the investment before recovery. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our
Consolidated Statement of Income.  Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standardwhich changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities. Specifically, the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who
should consolidate a variable interest entity, and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2010 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.  In August 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides additional guidance on the measurement of
liabilities at fair value.Specifically, when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, the new standard requires that the fair value of a liability be measured using one or more of the valuation
techniques that should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.In addition, an entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a
restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability.We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new
standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of the vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the
selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management's best estimate of the selling prices.In addition, the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation.In October 2009, the
FASB also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements.Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the
tangible products' essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple-element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above. Both standards will
be effective for us in the first quarter of 2011.Early adoption is permitted.We adopted these new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2010 using the prospective method and the adoption did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. Had we adopted these new standards in 2009, the impact on our consolidated financial statements would have been immaterial.

We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.  Foreign Exchange Risk  Economic Exposure  We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies. This exposes us to foreign currency risk. We purchase foreign
exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows
are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest income and other, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. Any gain after a hedge is de-designated
or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest income and other, net, immediately.  At December31,
2008, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 1.9 billion (or
approximately $2.6 billion) and $152.0 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were 1.1 billion (or approximately $1.8 billion) and $277.9 million; and the
notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$229.7million (or approximately $202.2 million) and $21.8 million. At December31, 2009, the notional principal and fair
value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 1.6 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) and $59.0
million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were 809.1million (or approximately $1.3 billion) and $39.4 million; and the notional principal and fair value of
foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$306.2 million (or approximately $267.9 million) and $5.9 million. These foreign exchange options have maturities of 36 months or less. There are no other foreign
exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. However, we may enter into similar contracts in other foreign currencies in the future.  We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for our foreign currencies instruments could be experienced in the near term.  If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income before tax effect would have been approximately $325
million and $15 million lower at December31, 2008 and 2009, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest income and other, net, would have been approximately $15 million and $68 million higher in the years ended December31, 2008
and 2009. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income before tax effect would have been approximately $750 million and $555 million higher at December31, 2008 and 2009, and the total
amount of expense recorded as interest income and other, net, would have been approximately $85 million and $75 million higher in the years ended December31, 2008 and 2009.  Transaction Exposure  Our
exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, primarily the
Euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency. We have entered into foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary.

The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009. The
notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $54.2 million and $115.4 million at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase
Euros with other currencies was 630.5million (or approximately $897.6 million) and 618.0million (or approximately $889.3 million) at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for
other foreign currencies was 7.9million (or approximately $11.3 million) at December31, 2009.  We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates
of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $16 million and $102 million at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009.
The adverse impact at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $555million and $594 million from forward exchange contracts in place for the months of December 2008 and
December 2009. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes
would have had on our income before taxes in the near term.  Interest Rate Risk  We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt
instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market mutual funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.  Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have
their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our income from investments may decrease in the
future.  We considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an
adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis-point) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately $83
million and $291 million at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders  Google Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December31, 2008 and 2009, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item15(a)2. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Google Inc. at December31, 2008 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
Google Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February12, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders  Google Inc.  We have audited Google Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the
COSO criteria). Google Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, Google Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December31, 2008 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009 of Google Inc. and our report dated February12, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Nature of Operations  We were incorporated in California in September 1998. We were re-incorporated in the State of
Delaware in August 2003. We provide highly targeted advertising and global internet search solutions as well as hosted applications.  Basis of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google and our wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, fair values of prepaid revenue share, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair
values of stock-based awards, and income taxes, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities.  Revenue Recognition  The following table presents our revenues by revenue source (in thousands):  
Google AdWords is our automated online program that enables
advertisers to place targeted text-based and display ads on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites. Display advertising includes static or animated images as well as interactive audio or video media, such as the banner ads on
the tops or sides of many popular web sites. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that
enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites as specified by the advertiser.  Google AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers' AdWords ads for display on the web sites of our Google
Network members as well as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts.

charged advertisers each time an ad is displayed on our members' sites. We report our Google AdSense revenues on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.  Google TV Ads enable advertisers, operators, and programmers to buy, schedule, deliver, and measure ads on television. We recognize as revenue the
fees charged advertisers each time an ad is displayed on television in accordance with the terms of the related agreements.  We also
offer display advertising management services such as media planning, buying, implementation, and measurement tools for advertisers and agencies and forecasting and reporting tools for publishers. We recognize the related fees as licensing and other
revenues in the period advertising impressions are delivered.  Google Checkout is our online shopping payment processing system for both
consumers and merchants. We recognize as revenues any fees charged to merchants on transactions processed through Google Checkout. Further, cash ultimately paid to merchants under Google Checkout promotions, including cash paid to merchants as a
result of discounts provided to consumers on certain transactions processed through Google Checkout, are accounted for as an offset to revenues.  We generate fees from search services on a per-query basis. Our policy is to recognize revenues from per-query search fees in the period we provide the search results.  We also generate fees from the sale and license of our Search Appliance products, which include hardware, software, and post-contract support
primarily for two years. As the deliverables are not sold separately, sufficient vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for the allocation of revenue. As a result, we recognized the entire fee for the sale and license of these products
ratably over the term of the post-contract support arrangement. Beginning the first quarter of 2010, we adopted the new accounting guidance which requires us to allocate the consideration of the arrangement to each of the deliverables based on our
best estimate of their selling prices as there is no vendor-specific objective or third-party evidence of the selling prices. As a result, we now recognize revenue allocated to the hardware and software at the time of sale and revenue allocated to
post-contract support ratably over the term of the service arrangement.  In addition, we generate fees through the license of our Google
Apps products. We recognize as revenue the fees we charge customers for hosting the related enterprise applications and services ratably over the term of the service arrangement.  Revenues realized through display advertising management services, Google TV Ads, Google Checkout, search services, Search Appliance, and Google Apps
were not material in any of the years presented.  We recognize revenues as described above because the services have been provided, the
fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed-upon transactions and collectability is reasonably assured.  We record deferred revenue when payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Google Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  
Cost of Revenues  Cost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network
members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our web site (collectively
referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share arrangements with our Google Network members and distribution partners.  Certain AdSense agreements obligate us to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google Network members based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or
advertisements displayed. These fees may be paid in advance or in arrears and are non-refundable but are subject to adjustment based on the achievement of the defined performance terms. In addition, the arrangements are terminable at will, although
under the terms of certain contracts we or our Google Network members may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. To the extent we expect revenues generated under an arrangement to exceed the guaranteed minimum revenue share
payments, we recognize traffic acquisition costs on a contractual revenue share basis or on a basis proportionate to forecasted revenues, whichever is greater. Otherwise, we recognize the guaranteed revenue share payments as traffic acquisition
costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the related agreements. For AdSense agreements under which we only pay on a contractual revenue share basis, we recognize the revenue share obligations as traffic acquisition costs at the same time the
related revenue is recognized. Also, concurrent with the commencement of a small number of AdSense and other agreements, we have purchased certain items from, or provided other consideration to, our Google Network members and partners. We have
determined that certain of these amounts are prepaid traffic acquisition costs and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related agreements.  In addition, certain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusivelyor at allbased on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable.
Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the
estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to
expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues. Further, we review the access points for impairment by distribution partner, type, and
geography, and we have not made any impairment to date.  Prepaid revenue share and distribution fees are included in prepaid revenue
share, expenses, and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Cost of revenues also includes the expenses
associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions including Google Checkout transactions, amortization of
acquired intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads
on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members' web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers and the Google Network members. To the extent we are obligated to
make guaranteed minimum revenue share or other payments to our content providers, we recognize content acquisition costs equal to the greater of the following three amounts: 1) the contractual revenue share
67

Google Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  
amount, if any, 2) an amount that is based on the number of times the content is displayed, or 3) an amount calculated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the agreements.  Stock-based Compensation  We
have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant.
Restricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the statutory withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our
employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding. Furthermore, we record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-in capital when
paid. Also, we recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line method.  We include as part of cash flows from financing
activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years ended December31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, the amount
of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $137.2 million, $72.5 million, and $350.2 million, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activity was $463.2 million, $250.9
million, and $260.2 million. We have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awardsprimarily the research and development tax creditthrough the income statement.  In the years ended December31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, we recognized stock-based compensation and related tax benefits of $868.6 million and
$143.0 million, $1,119.8 million and $231.7 million, and $1,164.1 million and $264.0 million.  Certain Risks and Concentrations 
Our revenues are principally derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In
addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the globe. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating
results.  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents,
marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt
instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various major corporations and financial institutions with high credit
standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the globe. In 2007, 2008, and 2009, we generated approximately 52%, 49%, and 47% of our revenues from customers based in the
U.S., with the majority of customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. Many of our Google Network members are in the internet industry. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we
extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.  No advertiser or Google Network member generated greater than 10% of revenues in 2007, 2008, and 2009.

Google Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities,
approximate fair value because of their generally short maturities. We carry marketable securities and foreign currency contracts at fair value. See Notes 3 and 4 below for more information.  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign government, time deposits, money market
mutual funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated
maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.  We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in
marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-for-sale. We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities
greater than 12 months until maturity. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to
support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders' equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary which we record as interest income and other, net. We determine any realized gains or losses
on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest income and other, net.  Non-Marketable Equity Securities  We have accounted for non-marketable equity security
investments primarily at cost because we do not have significant influence over the underlying investees.  Impairment of Marketable
and Non-Marketable Securities  We periodically review our marketable securities, as well as our non-marketable equity securities, for
impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the
reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the investment before recovery. If any impairment is considered
other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Accounts Receivable  We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we do not charge
interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or
collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to
customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.  
69

Google Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  
Property and Equipment  We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property (including land) and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and
depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for their intended use.  Software Development
Costs  We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to
be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. We have determined that technological feasibility was reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development costs incurred
after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products were not material, and accordingly, were expensed as incurred. Software development costs also include costs to develop software programs to be used solely
to meet our internal needs. The costs we incurred during the application development stage for these software programs were not material in the years presented.  Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  We review property
and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying
amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
asset exceeds its fair market value. We have made no material adjustments to our long-lived assets in any of the years presented. In addition, we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. Our tests are based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure. We found no material impairment in any of the years presented.  Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line
basis with definite lives over periods ranging primarily from one to 12 years.  Income Taxes  We recognize income taxes under the liability method. We recognize deferred income taxes for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases
of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.  Foreign Currency  Generally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and
average rates of exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders' equity. We recorded $61.0 million of
70 
Table of Contents
Google Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  
net translation gains in 2007, $84.2 million of net translation losses in 2008, and $76.7 million of net translation gains in 2009. We record net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange
transactions as a component of interest income and other, net. These gains and losses are net of those realized on forward foreign exchange contracts. We recorded $16.2 million and $35.6 million of net losses in 2007 and 2008, and $8.2 million of
net gains in 2009 from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the local currency.  Legal Costs 
Legal costs are expensed as incurred.  Advertising and Promotional Expenses  We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are
incurred. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $236.7 million, $266.4 million, and $353.4 million.  Subsequent Events  In May 2009,
the FASB issued a new accounting standardwhich established general accounting standards and disclosure for subsequent events. In accordance with this standard, we evaluated subsequent events through February12, 2010, the date we filed
this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standardwhich changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities. Specifically, the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who
should consolidate a variable interest entity, and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2010 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.  In August 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides additional guidance on the measurement of
liabilities at fair value.Specifically, when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, the new standard requires that the fair value of a liability be measured using one or more of the valuation
techniques that should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.In addition, an entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a
restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability.We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new
standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of the vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the
selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management's best estimate of the selling prices.In addition, the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation.In October 2009, the
FASB also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements.Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the
tangible products' essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple-element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above. Both standards will
be effective for us in the first quarter of 2011.Early adoption is permitted.We adopted these
71 
Table of Contents
Google Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  
new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2010 using the prospective method and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Had we adopted these
new standards in 2009, the impact on our consolidated financial statements would have been immaterial.  
We compute net income per share of ClassA and Class B common stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period except that it does not include unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding
during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, warrants, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation.
The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and warrants is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of
ClassA common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.  The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our ClassA and Class B common stock are identical, except with
respect to voting. Further, there are a number of safeguards built into our Certificate of Incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our ClassA and
Class B common stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation which would have the affect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock (in this case the right of
our ClassA common stock to receive an equal dividend to any declared on our Class B common stock) must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that
before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of
the ClassA and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Further, as we assume the
conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of ClassA common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.

Gross unrealized gains and losses on cash equivalents were not material at December31,
2008 and December31, 2009.  Our corporate debt securities are primarily guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) or the sovereign guarantee of foreign governments under similar programs to the TLGP.  Our agency residential mortgage-backed securities are specified pools of mortgage pass-through securities that are guaranteed by government-sponsored
enterprises. Our commercial mortgage-backed securities are fully defeased securities with underlying collateral loans replacedby U.S. Treasury notes.  Our marketable equity security consists of our investment in Clearwire.  We recognized gross realized
gains of $105.8 million and $118.3 million for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2009. Gross realized losses were not material in all periods presented. We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a
specific identification method, and we reflect such gains and losses as a component of interest income and other, net, in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable securities, excluding the marketable equity security,
designated as available-for-sale and classified by the contractual maturity date of the security (in thousands):

The following tables presents gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that
were in an unrealized loss position as of December31, 2008 and 2009, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in thousands):  
As of December31, 2008 and 2009, we did not have any investments in marketable securities
that were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater.  Auction Rate Securities  At December31, 2009, we held $181.7 million of auction rate securities (ARS). The assets underlying these 33 individual investments are primarily
student loans which are mostly AAA rated and substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Historically, these securities have provided liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the
applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals every 7 to 49 days. However, these auctions began to fail in the first quarter of 2008. Since these auctions have failed, we have realized higher interest rates for many of these ARS than we would
have otherwise. Although we have been receiving interest payments at these generally higher rates, the related principal amounts will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuer
calls the security, or the security matures according to contractual terms. Maturity dates for these ARS investments range from 2025 to 2047. Since these auctions have failed, $65.3 million of the related securities were called at par by their
issuers.  As a result of the auction failures, these ARS do not have a readily determinable market value. To estimate their fair values
at December31, 2009, we used a discounted cash flow model based on estimated interest rates, timing, and amount of cash flows, the credit quality of the underlying securities, and illiquidity considerations. Specifically, we estimated the
future cash flows of our ARS over the expected workout periods using a projected weighted-average interest rate of 4.15%per annum, which is based on the forward swap curve at the end of December 2009 plus any additional basis points currently
paid by the issuers assuming these auctions continue to
76 
Table of Contents
Google Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  
fail. A discount factor was applied over these estimated cash flows of our ARS, which is calculated based on the interpolated forward swap curve adjusted by up to 2,000 basis points to reflect
the current market conditions for instruments with similar credit quality at the date of the valuation and additionally adjusted for a liquidity discount of up to 400 basis points to reflect the risk in the marketplace for these investments that has
arisen due to the lack of an active market.  At December31, 2009, the estimated fair value of these ARS was $23.4 million less
than their costs. As we have no intent to sell these ARS and it is more-likely-than-not that we will not be required to sell these ARS prior to recovery, we concluded the decline in the fair value was temporary and recorded the unrealized loss to
accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31, 2009.  To the extent we
determine that any impairment is other-than-temporary, we would record a charge to earnings. In addition, we have concluded that the auctions for these securities may continue to fail for at least the next 12 months and as a result, we classified
them as non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31, 2009.  Liquidation of Investment in
AOL  In 2009, we recognized a gain of $9.0 million on the sale of our equity investment in America Online, Inc. to Time Warner Inc.
for $283.0 million.  
We enter into
foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and fair value of certain marketable securities will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our program is not
designated for trading or speculative purposes.  We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance
sheet at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as interest income and other, net, as part of revenues, or to accumulated other comprehensive
income (AOCI) on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Cash Flow Hedges  We use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We
initially report any gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and we subsequently reclassify those gains to revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest income and other, net, if the hedged
transaction becomes probable of not occurring.  At December31, 2009, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax
effect was $15.5 million, of which $8.9 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to revenues within the next 12 months.  We
recognize any gain after a hedge is de-designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge in interest income and other, net, immediately. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge
effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option whose strike price is equal to or greater than the market price on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize any change to this time value in interest income and
other, net.

The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros was 1.9 billion (or approximately $2.6 billion) and 1.6 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009; the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds was 1.1 billion (or
approximately $1.8 billion) and 809.1million (or approximately $1.3 billion) at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009; and the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars
was C$229.7 million (or approximately $202.2 million) and C$306.2 million (or approximately $267.9 million) at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009. These foreign exchange options have maturities of 36 months or less. There were no
other foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.  Fair Value Hedges  In November 2009, we began using forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in interest income and other, net along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in the time value for forward
contacts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize them in interest income and other, net. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $37.3 million at December31,
2009.  Other Derivatives  Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a
subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in interest income and other, net, along with the gains and losses of the related hedged items. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to
purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $54.2 million
and $115.4 million at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other currencies was 630.5million (or approximately $897.6 million) and 618.0million (or approximately
$889.3 million) at December31, 2008 and December31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for other foreign currencies was 7.9million (or approximately $11.3 million) at December31, 2009.

between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as
a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:  Level1Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  Level2Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.  Level3Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities.  The fair value hierarchy also
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

Google Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  
We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2. This is
because we value our cash equivalents and marketable securities using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. We classify our investments in ARS within Level 3 because they are valued using
valuation techniques (see Note 3). Some of the inputs to these models are unobservable in the market and are significant. We classify our foreign currency derivative contracts within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and
market observable data of similar instruments.  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below

amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger with On2. Upon the consummation of the merger, each stockholder of On2 will have the right to receive 0.0010 shares of Google ClassA common
stock, $0.15of cash, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The total purchase price is approximately $124 million based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on February 10, 2010. The completion of this transaction is subject
to On2 stockholder approval. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2010.  On November9, 2009, we signed a
definitive agreement to acquire AdMob, Inc., a privately-held mobile display ads technology provider, for $750 million in Google ClassA common stock. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. We expect this

Operating Leases
We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout
the world with original lease periods expiring between 2010 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain
of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.  At December31, 2009, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, along with sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five years and thereafter (in thousands):
Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts
in the table above represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases. Rent expense under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $164.3 million, $313.6 million, and $323.2 million in 2007, 2008, and
2009.  Guaranteed Minimum Revenue Share Payments  In connection with our AdSense revenue share agreements, we are periodically required to make non-cancelable guaranteed minimum payments to a small number of our Google Network members over the term of the
respective contracts. Under our contracts, these guaranteed payments may be adjusted downward based on our Google Network members not achieving defined performance targets, such as number of advertisements displayed or search queries. In most cases,
certain guaranteed amounts will be adjusted downward if our Google Network members do not meet their performance targets. In all of these AdSense agreements, if a Google Network member were unable to perform under the contract, such as being unable
to provide search queries, as defined under the terms of that agreement, then we would not be obligated to make any non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue payments to that member. At December31, 2009, our aggregate outstanding
non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share commitments totaled $133.3 million through 2012 compared to $1,030.3million at December31, 2008. We believe these amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the future minimum guaranteed
payments.

Purchase Obligations  We had $360.7 million of other non-cancelable contractual obligations and $1.9 billion of open purchase orders for which we had not received the
related services or goods at December31, 2009. We have the right to cancel these open purchase orders prior to the date of delivery. The majority of our non-cancelable contractual obligations are related to data center operations and facility
build-outs.  Letters of Credit  At December31, 2009 and associated with several leased facilities, we had unused letters of credit for $101.2 million. At December31, 2009, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the
letters of credit.  Indemnifications  In the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We
have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within
which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, the payments we have made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or cash
flows.  Legal Matters  Companies have filed trademark infringement and related claims against us over the display of ads in response to user queries that include trademark terms. The outcomes of these lawsuits have differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We
currently have three cases pending at the European Court of Justice, which will address questions regarding whether advertisers and search engines can be held liable for use of trademarked terms in keyword advertising. We are litigating, or have
recently litigated similar issues in other cases, in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.  We have also had copyright claims filed against us alleging that features of certain of our products and services, including Google Web Search, Google News, Google Video, Google Image Search, Google Book Search,
and YouTube, infringe their rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain functionalities, and may also result in a
change in our business practices, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or otherwise harm our business. In addition, any time one of our products or services links to or hosts material in which others allegedly own copyrights, we face the
risk of being sued for copyright infringement or related claims. Because these products and services comprise the majority of our products and services, our business could be harmed in the event of an adverse result in any of these claims.
We have also had patent lawsuits filed against us alleging that certain of our products and services, including Android, Google Web
Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, and Google Chrome, infringe patents held by others. In addition, the number of demands for license fees and the dollar amounts associated with each request
87 
Table of Contents
Google Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  
continue to increase. Adverse results in these lawsuits, or our decision to license patents based upon these demands, may result in substantial costs and, in the case of adverse litigation
results, could prevent us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or otherwise harm our business.  We are also a party to other litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims (in
addition to the trademark and copyright matters noted above), labor and employment claims and threatened claims, breach of contract claims, tax, and other matters.  Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of the matters discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  EPA Investigation  In February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller
data facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We are cooperating with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials. The EPA investigation could result in fines, civil or criminal
penalties, or other administrative action.  We currently believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  Income Taxes  We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and various other tax authorities. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our
provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of
operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates
of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.  
Convertible Preferred
Stock  Our Board of Directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series.
At December31, 2008 and 2009, there were no shares issued or outstanding.  ClassA and Class B Common Stock
Our Board of Directors has authorized two classes of common stock, ClassA and Class B. At December31, 2009, there were
6,000,000,000 and 3,000,000,000 shares authorized and there were 243,611,368 and 74,160,683 shares legally outstanding of ClassA and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of ClassA and Class B common stock are identical, except
with respect to voting. Each share of ClassA common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the
stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to ClassA common stock. We refer to ClassA and Class B common stock as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.

Stock Plans  We maintain the 1998 Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan (No.2), the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 3), the 2004 Stock Plan, and plans assumed through acquisitions, all of which
are collectively referred to as the Stock Plans. Under our Stock Plans, incentive and nonqualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term of 10
years. Except for options granted pursuant to the Exchange discussed below, options granted under the Stock Plans generally vest 25% after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36 month period contingent upon employment
with us on the vesting date. Options granted under Stock Plans other than the 2004 Stock Plan may be exercised prior to vesting.  Under
the Stock Plans, we have also issued RSUs and restricted shares. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our stock at the time of vest. RSUs issued to new employees vest over four years with a yearly cliff contingent upon employment with us
on the dates of vest. These RSUs vest from zero to 50.0% of the grant amount at the end of each of the four years from date of hire based on the employee's performance. RSUs under the Founders' Award programs are issued to individuals on
teams that have made extraordinary contributions to Google. These awards vest quarterly over four years contingent upon employment with us on the vesting dates.  At December31, 2008 and December31, 2009, there were 23,236,325 and 27,042,948 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plans.  We estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option pricing model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility
have been based exclusively on the implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to our employees. Through the third quarter of 2007, our assumptions about the
expected term had been based on that of companies that had option vesting and contractual terms, expected stock volatility, employee demographics, and physical locations that were similar to ours because we had limited relevant historical
information to support the expected sale and exercise behavior of our employees who had been granted options recently. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2007, we began to estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of
our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted (excluding options granted in connection with the Exchange discussed below) in the periods
presented:

The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2007, 2008, and 2009 was $635.1
million, $692.5 million, and $689.7 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2007, 2008 and 2009 was $1,279.0 million, $503.2 million, and $566.1 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales
price of options sold under our TSO program.  During 2009, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial institutions
under the TSO program was approximately 1.1million at a total value of $246.8 million, or an average of $231.36 per share, including an average premium of $23.39 per share. The premium is calculated as the difference between (a)the sale
price of the TSO and (b)the intrinsic value of the TSO, which we define as the excess, if any, of the price of our ClassA common stock at the time of the sale over the exercise price of the TSO. At December31 2009, the number of
options eligible for participation under the TSO program was approximately 10 million.  In March 2009, we completed an offer to exchange
certain employee stock options issued under our 2004 Stock Plan. Certain previously granted options were exchanged for new options with a lower exercise price granted on a one-for-one basis. Options for an aggregate of approximately 7.6million
shares of our ClassA common stock were exchanged. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have an exercise price of $308.57 per share, the closing price of our ClassA common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market on
March6, 2009. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have a new vesting schedule determined by adding 12 months to each vesting date under the exchanged options' original vesting schedule. In addition, new options will vest no sooner
than six months after the date of the Exchange. The Exchange resulted in a modification charge of approximately $360 million which is being recognized over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting periods range from six months to five
years. We recorded approximately $103 million of the modification charge in 2009.  As of December31, 2009, there was $1,088.0
million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.1 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have
anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.  The following table summarizes
the activities for our unvested RSUs and restricted shares for the year ended December31, 2009:  
As of December31, 2009, there was $1,842.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to employee unvested RSUs and restricted shares. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 3.0 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.

We have a 401(k) Savings Plan
(401(k)Plan)that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 60% of their eligible compensation, subject
to certain limitations. Employee and our contributions are fully vested when contributed. We contributed approximately $51.1 million, $72.6 million, and $82.5 million during 2007, 2008, and 2009.  
Income before income taxes included
income from foreign operations of $2,466.9 million, $3,793.7 million, and $4,802.1 million for 2007, 2008, and 2009.  The provision for

We have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign

any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December31, 2009, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately
$12.3 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.  Deferred Tax Assets  Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):  
As of December31, 2009, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $187.8 million and $97.6 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2011. The net operating loss
carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code.  In the fourth quarter of
2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.09 billion related primarily to our investments in AOL and Clearwire. For income tax purposes, the impairment will generate an equal amount of capital loss when recognized, a portion of which was
recognized in 2009. As of December31, 2009, our federal and state capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $776.0 million and $961.6 million. If not utilized, the federal capital losses will begin to expire in
2014. We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the capital loss carryforwards will not be realized. Therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance on both our federal and state capital loss carryforwards in the amount of $326.2
million. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.

Uncertain Tax Positions  The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January1, 2007 to December31, 2009 (in
thousands):  
Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $283.5 million,
$561.3 million, and $814.4 million as of December31, 2007, December31, 2008, and December31, 2009.  As of
December31, 2009, we had accrued $100.0 million for payment of interest and penalties. Interest and penalties included in our provision for income taxes was not material in all the periods presented.  We and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Although we file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns, our
two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Ireland. During the three months ended December31, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. We have filed an appeal with the IRS for certain
issues related to this audit, but we believe we have adequately provided for these items and any adverse results would have an immaterial impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balance within the next 12 months. The IRS commenced its examination of
our 2005 and 2006 tax years in early 2008. We do not expect the examination to be completed within the next 12 months, therefore we do not anticipate any significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance in 2009, related to our 2005 and
2006 tax years.  Our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2002
through 2009 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are various other on-going audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.

(a) Evaluation of
disclosure controls and procedures.  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  Based onmanagement's evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December31, 2009, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable
assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  Weregularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and
increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December31, 2009 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  (c)
Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.  Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31,
2009. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
