Apple Inc.  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) design, manufacture,
and market personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sell a variety of related software, digital content, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide
through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products including
application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB), education,
enterprise, government, and creative customers.  Basis of Presentation and Preparation  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  Certain prior year amounts in the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. In the current period, the Company reclassified $2.4billion of certain fixed-income securities from short-term marketable
securities to long-term marketable securities. The reclassification resulted from a change in accounting presentation for certain investments based on contractual maturity dates, which more closely reflects the Company's assessment of the
timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are
classified as long-term. There have been no changes in the Company's investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting presentation. See Note 2, Financial Instruments of this Form 10-Q for additional
information.  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the
Company's annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September27, 2008, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2008 Form 10-K). Unless otherwise stated, references to
particular years or quarters refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.  Earnings
Per Common Share  Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding options, shares to be
purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, and unvested restricted stock units (RSUs). The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method.
Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.  
5 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three
months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):  
Potentially dilutive securities representing approximately 18.8million and 7.6million
shares of common stock for the quarters ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive.
Fair Value Measurements  During the
first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No.157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair
value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various
other accounting pronouncements. The adoption of SFAS No.157 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results.  SFAS No.157 establishes a hierarchy for information and valuations used in measuring fair value, which is broken down into three levels. Level 1 valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 valuations are based on inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 valuations are based on information that is unobservable and
significant to the overall fair value measurement.  The Company also adopted SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilitiesincluding an amendment of FASB Statement No.115, during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. SFAS No.159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No.159 requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. The Company
adopted SFAS No.159 but has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments as of December27, 2008.  Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements of this Form 10-Q for additional information on the adoption of SFAS Nos. 157 and 159.

Note 2  Financial Instruments  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  The following table summarizes the fair value of
the Company's cash and available-for-sale securities held in its marketable securities investment portfolio, recorded as cash, cash equivalents, short-term or long-term marketable securities as of December27, 2008 and September27,
2008 (in millions):  
As of December27, 2008, the Company changed its accounting presentation for certain
fixed-income investments, which resulted in the reclassification of certain investments from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities. As a result, prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current
period's presentation. The Company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument's underlying contractual maturity date, while its prior classifications were based on the nature of the
securities and their availability for use in current operations. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months
are classified as long-term. The Company's long-term marketable securities' maturities range from one year to five years. The Company believes this new presentation is preferable as it more closely reflects the Company's assessment of
the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. Accordingly, certain fixed-income investments totaling $2.4billion have been reclassified from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in the
September27, 2008 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the current period's financial statement presentation. There have been no changes in the Company's investment policies or practices associated with this change in
accounting presentation.  The Company had net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio of $39 million and $117 million as of
December27, 2008 and September27, 2008, respectively. In both periods, the net unrealized losses related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for
strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during the first quarters of 2009 or 2008 related to such sales.  
7 
The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value for investments in an unrealized
loss position as of December27, 2008 and September27, 2008, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):  
The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment
portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Company's marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. The Company typically invests in highly-rated
securities, and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value
has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. During the first quarters of
2009 or 2008, the Company did not recognize any material impairment charges on outstanding securities. As of December27, 2008, the Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company uses
derivatives to offset partially its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign
exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not
hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The
Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings. The effective
portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other 
8 
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in deferred translation as
a component of other comprehensive income. Changes in value of fair value hedges are offset against the changes in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings.  As of December27, 2008, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $105 million, net of taxes. The
portion of the Company's net deferred gain related to products under subscription accounting is expected to be recorded in earnings ratably over a 24-month period beginning when the hedged transaction occurs, while the portion of the net
deferred gain related to other products is expected to be recorded in earnings at the time the hedged transaction occurs. As of December27, 2008, the hedged transactions are expected to occur within six months. As of the end of the first
quarter of 2009, the general nature of the Company's risk management activities and the general nature and mix of the Company's derivative financial instruments have not changed materially from the end of 2008.  Note 3  Fair Value Measurements  In the first
quarter of 2009, the Company adopted SFAS No.157 for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. SFAS
No.157 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for
assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit risk.  SFAS No.157
also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level
of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. SFAS No.157 establishes and prioritizes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 -
Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 - Inputs that are generally
unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Note 5  Income Taxes  As of December27, 2008, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $560million, of which $247 million, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate. As of
September27, 2008, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $506 million, of which $253 million, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate. The Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits are
classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had $247 million and $219 million of gross interest and penalties accrued as of December27, 2008 and September27, 2008, respectively,
which are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Management believes that an adequate
provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not
consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, the Company
does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12months.  Note 6 
Shareholders' Equity  Preferred Stock  The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter
the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.  Comprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, the effective portion of foreign currency net investment hedges, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  The following
table summarizes the components of total comprehensive income, net of taxes, during the three months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007 (in millions):

taxes, as of December27, 2008 and September27, 2008 (in millions):  
Employee Benefit Plans  Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans  The following executive officers, Timothy D. Cook, Peter Oppenheimer, Philip W. Schiller, and
Bertrand Serlet, have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of January19, 2009. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes
the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the
Company's employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs.  Stock Option Activity  A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the three months ended December27, 2008 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts and
contractual term in years):  
Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on the
last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative
intrinsic value. The total intrinsic value of options at the time of exercise was $55 million and $887 million for the three months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007, respectively.  
13 
Shares of RSUs granted after April 2005 have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the
Company's stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, shares of RSUs cancelled have been added back to the shares available for grant under the Company's stock option plans utilizing a factor
of two times the number of RSUs cancelled.  Restricted Stock Units  The Company's Board of Directors has granted RSUs to members of the Company's executive management team, excluding its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), as well as various employees within the
Company. RSUs generally vest over four years either at the end of the four-year service period, in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, in equal installments on each of the first through fourth
anniversaries of the grant date, or in equal installments on each semi-annual anniversary of the grant date. Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an
equivalent number of shares of common stock.  Outstanding RSU balances were not included in the outstanding options balances in the
preceding table. A summary of the Company's RSU activity and related information for the three months ended December27, 2008 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):  
RSUs that vested during the three months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007
had a fair value of $86 million and $43 million, respectively, as of the vesting date.  Note 7  Stock-Based Compensation  SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The
Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards.The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life, and
interest rates.The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options and other relevant
factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees.
Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
The compensation expense incurred by the Company for RSUs is based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the
date of grant and is amortized ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  
14 
The weighted average assumptions used for the three months ended December27, 2008 and
December29, 2007 and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) during those periods are as follows:  
The following table provides a summary of the stock-based compensation expense included in the
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007 (in millions):  
Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as part of software development costs was not
significant as of December27, 2008 or December29, 2007. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $66 million and $34 million for the three months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007,
respectively. As of December27, 2008, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.8 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 3.02
years.  Note 8  Commitments and Contingencies  Lease Commitments  The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable
operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 years. Leases
for retail space are generally for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September27, 2008, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases were $1.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion related to leases for retail space. As of December27, 2008, total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases related to leases for retail space
decreased $44 million to $1.3 billion.  
15 
Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications  The following table reconciles changes in the Company's accrued warranties and related costs for the three months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007 (in millions):
The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application
software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or
damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an
indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating
results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either December27, 2008 or September27, 2008.  Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  Although most components essential to the
Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), certain optical drives, and
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are
available from multiple sources including, but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In
addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able
to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases
that can have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results.  The Company and other participants in the
personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, the Company uses some custom components
that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has
evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured. If the Company's
supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to
the Company, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain
sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to
concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.  Significant
portions of the Company's Mac computers, iPods, iPhones, logic boards, and other assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing
is currently performed by only a few of the Company's outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and 
16 
manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Company's key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Company's
portable Mac computers, iPods, iPhones and most of the Company's iMacs. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its
outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company's purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.  Long-Term Supply Agreements  During 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with
Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid
$1.25billion, which is being applied to certain inventory component purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the long-term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and
the remaining prepaid balance of $167million was repaid to the Company. As of December27, 2008, the Company had $428million of inventory component prepayments outstanding.  Subsequent to December27, 2008, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement with LG Display to purchase LCD panels for five years. As part of the agreement, the Company is
required to make a prepayment of $500million in the second quarter of 2009.  Contingencies  The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or
operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same
reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  Production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful
life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia,
certain Canadian provinces and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such
existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results.  Note 9 
Segment Information and Geographic Data  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No.131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting
used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.  The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail,
and FileMaker operations. The Company's reportable operating segments consist of Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail operations. Other operating segments include Asia Pacific, which encompasses Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the
Company's FileMaker, Inc. subsidiary. The Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific segments exclude activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European
countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services
to the same types of customers. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in the Company's 2008 Form 10-K.  
17 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income.
Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Company's retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties,
related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income
and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and
development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between
segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired
intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $71 million and $75 million during the
first quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The Company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as
high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the
Company's more typical retail stores. The Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs
to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 11 high-profile stores as of December27, 2008. Expenses
allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $16 million and $11 million in the first quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Summary information by operating segment for the three months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007 is as follows (in millions):

Executive Overview  The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking
solutions. The Company's products and services include the Mac line of desktop and portable computers, the iPod line of
portable digital music players, iPhoneTM, Apple TV, Xserve, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, third-party digital content through the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party
wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other
accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB), education, enterprise, government, and creative markets. A further description of the Company's
products may be found below under the heading Products and Part II, Item1A, Risk Factors, as well as in Part I, Item1, Business, of the Company's 2008 Form 10-K.  The Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government and creative customers that
greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles and workplace. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer and consumer electronics industries that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer, including the
hardware, operating system, and sophisticated software applications, as well as the design and development of portable digital music players, mobile communication devices, and a variety of products and solutions for obtaining and enjoying digital
content. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle products and solutions, which are further enhanced by the Company's emphasis on ease-of-use and creative industrial designs.
The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers,
consumer electronics with its iPod product families, mobile communications with iPhone, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal
computer and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To 
20 
remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or
expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Company's RD spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of personal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new
digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand
awareness.  The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative
and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on Mac computers, and
demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure
a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company
had 251 stores open as of December27, 2008.  The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple
Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac
computers and other products over those of its competitors.The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its direct sales force.  The Company's iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. iPods can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores,
large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above.  iPhone is distributed
through the Company, its cellular network carriers' distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers. The Company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide
cellular network services for iPhone 3G. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Spain, Ireland, and certain other countries. The Company has shipped iPhone 3G in over 70 countries as
of December 2008.  Products  The
Company offers a range of personal computing products including desktop and portable personal computers, related devices and peripherals, and various third-party hardware and software products. In addition, the Company offers its own software
products, including Mac OS X, the Company's proprietary operating system software for the Mac; server software and related solutions; professional application software; and consumer, education, and business oriented application software. The
Company also designs, develops, and markets to Mac and Windows users its family of iPod digital music players and its iPhone mobile communication device, along with related accessories and services, including the online distribution of third-party
content through the Company's iTunes Store.  In January 2009, the Company
announced its redesigned 17-inch MacBook Pro model, which includes the all-metal unibody enclosure and a new built-in battery that delivers up to eight hours of use and up to 1,000
recharges. The new 17-inch MacBook Pro has a widescreen light-emitting diode display, Intel Core 2 Duo processors running at up to 2.93GHz, and the NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT graphics processor. The Company expects to begin shipping the new 17-inch
MacBook Pro in late January 2009.  In January 2009, the Company announced iLife '09, which features major upgrades to iPhoto, iMovie and
GarageBand, and includes iDVD and an updated version of iWeb. iPhoto '09 adds Faces and Places as new ways to easily
organize and manage photos, iMovie '09 adds new features including Precision Editor and video stabilization, and GarageBand '09 introduces a new way to help users learn to play the piano and guitar. The Company expects to begin shipping
iLife '09 in late January 2009.  In January 2009, the Company introduced and released iWork '09, the latest version of its office productivity suite, which features upgrades to
Keynote, Pages and Numbers. Among the new features in iWork,
Keynote '09 introduces advanced object transitions, Pages '09 features a new full screen view, and Numbers '09 introduces a quick way to group and summarize data and a simplified way to create complex formulas.

A detailed discussion of the Company's other products may be found in Part I, Item1,
Business, of the Company's 2008 Form 10-K.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2008 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods
used in the preparation of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.  Management believes the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of marketable securities, allowance for doubtful accounts,
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these critical policies because they are both important to the portrayal of the
Company's financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and
related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition  Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support
contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) No.03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software, (e.g., Mac computers, iPod portable digital music players and iPhone)
pursuant to American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No.97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. For products that are not software or software-related, (e.g.,
digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories), the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
No.104, Revenue Recognition.  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because
the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and
subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.  For both Apple TV
and iPhone, the Company has indicated that from time-to-time it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Therefore, sales of Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under subscription
accounting in accordance with SOP No.97-2. The Company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss recognized at the
time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing, and warranty are expensed as incurred.  The Company records
reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price
protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue 
22 
recognition have been met. The Company's policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable
estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered.
The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs
and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers
who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required
to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations.  Valuation of Marketable
Securities  The Company's investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses
related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of investments impact the
Company's net income only when such investments are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security's cost basis. The
Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge
in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating of the investment and any
changes thereto, and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. The Company's assessment on whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could change
in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain education,
consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to
limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs
to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to
any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the ability to collect specific customer accounts and
includes consideration of the credit-worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. The Company also
records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels, and the aging of
such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade
receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.  Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have
become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product
development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and 
23 
unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less
favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the
write-downs were recorded.  The Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been
cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments
typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements
for any of the Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.  Warranty Costs  The Company provides for the
estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are
outside of the Company's typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection
and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No.97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from
estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company's results of operations.  The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software's compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is
recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and
estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123
(revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. Under the provisions of SFAS No.123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)
option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The BSM option-pricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected
option life. Significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock-based awards granted in the future.   Income Taxes  The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of
operations. In accordance with SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently
enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more
likely than not to be realized.  The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109, whereby the Company only recognizes the tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements
from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  
24 
Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be
generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of
the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities
involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of FIN 48 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material
impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Legal and Other Contingencies  As discussed in Part II, Item1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Note 8 Commitments and
Contingencies in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No.5, Accounting for
Contingencies, the Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an
exposure can be reasonably estimated. In management's opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of
these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  
25 
Net Sales  The following table summarizes net sales and Mac unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during the three months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007 (in millions, except unit sales in
thousands and per unit amounts):  
26 
Net sales during the first quarter of 2009 increased $559 million or 6% compared to the same quarter in
2008. Several factors contributed positively to this increase, including the following:  
Net sales and unit sales of the Company's Mac portable systems increased by 23% and 34%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same quarter in 2008. The growth in Mac portable systems was
attributable to strong demand for the MacBook and MacBook Pro, which had year-over-year unit sales growth in each of the Company's reportable operating segments. Conversely, net sales and unit sales of the Company's Mac desktop systems
decreased by 31% and 25%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same quarter in 2008. This decline was due primarily to decreased net sales and unit sales of iMac in each of the Company's reportable operating segments.
Partially offsetting the favorable factors, discussed above, net sales during the first quarter of 2009 were negatively impacted by
certain factors, including the following:  
Segment Operating Performance  The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable
segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates
Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the Retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services.  
27 
Americas  Net sales in the Americas segment during the first quarter of 2009 increased $203 million or 5% over the first quarter of 2008, while Americas Mac unit sales increased 8% year-over-year. The increase in net sales during the first quarter of
2009 was attributable to higher sales of iPhone, Mac portable systems, and sales from the iTunes Store, which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of iPods, iMac, and software, as well as the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S.
dollar. Sales of Mac portable products increased due primarily to strong demand for MacBook and MacBook Pro, both of which were updated in October 2008. The Americas segment represented 44% and 45% of the Company's total net sales in the first
quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Europe  Net sales in Europe increased $300 million or 12% during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter in 2008. This growth was driven primarily by iPhone, with Mac portable systems and sales from the iTunes
Store also contributing to the increase in net sales. The net sales increase was partially offset by lower year-over-year sales of iPods and iMac, as well as the effect of foreign currency movements against the U.S. dollar during the first quarter
of 2009. Total Mac unit sales in Europe increased 13% year-over-year, due primarily to an increase in net sales of Mac portable systems, particularly MacBook.  Japan  Japan's net sales increased $81 million or 20% during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of
2008, while Mac unit sales increased 9% year-over-year. The key contributors to Japan's net sales growth were increased sales of iPhone, Mac portable systems, and iPods, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the Japanese yen, which were
partially offset by a decrease in sales of iMac. Net sales and unit sales of iPods increased during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter in 2008, driven primarily by strong demand for iPod nano, which was updated in September
2008.  Retail  Retail net sales
increased $39 million or 2% during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008, and Mac unit sales increased 2% over the same period. The increase in net sales was due to higher sales of iPhone and Mac portable systems, which
were partially offset by lower sales of iPods, iMac, and software. Retail Mac unit sales grew due to increased sales of Mac portable systems, partially offset by lower sales of iMac. The Company opened four new retail stores during the first quarter
of 2009, ending the quarter with 251 stores open as compared to 204 stores at the end of the first quarter of 2008. The growth in Retail net sales was less than the growth in the number of stores open. As a result, with an average of 249 stores and
201 stores open during the first quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively, average revenue per store declined to $7.0 million for the first quarter of 2009 from $8.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. The Retail segment reported operating income
of $353 million during the first quarter of 2009 compared to operating income of $405 million during the first quarter in 2008. The year-over-year decrease in operating income is attributable primarily to lower average revenue per store. 
Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure,
operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled $1.5 billion through the end of the first quarter of 2009. As of December27, 2008, the
Retail segment had approximately 15,600 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding lease commitments associated with retail space of $1.3 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores and such
costs could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Other Segments  The Company's Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced a decrease in net sales of $64 million, or 9%
during the first quarter of 2009 as compared to the same quarter in 2008. The decrease in net sales was due primarily to lower net sales of iPods and iMacs, as well as a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and other Asian
currencies, which were partially offset by increased net sales of iPhone and Mac portable systems. Mac unit sales increased 14% during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008, related primarily to strong demand for the
MacBook, which was updated in October 2008.  
28 
Gross Margin  Gross margin for the three months ended December27, 2008 and December29, 2007 was as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):  
Gross margin percentage for the first quarter of 2009 and 2008 was flat at 34.7%.  The Company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, and
anticipates gross margin levels of about 32.5% in the second quarter of 2009 and about 30% in the second half of 2009. This expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new and
innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a stronger U.S. dollar, and higher logistical costs.  The foregoing statements regarding the Company's expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not
limited to certain of those set forth below in Part II, Item1A, Risk Factors under the subheading Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to
microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities, which is incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In
general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles,
product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), as well as
potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company's sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to
take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its
products. Due to the Company's significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses for the three months ended December27, 2008 and
December29, 2007, were as follows (in millions, except for percentages):  
Research and Development (RD)  Expenditures for RD increased 28% or $69 million to $315 million in the first quarter of 2009 compared to $246 million in the first quarter of 2008, which was due primarily to higher
stock-based compensation expenses and an increase in RD headcount in the current year to support expanded RD activities. In addition, $22 million of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard
and excluded from RD expense during the first quarter of 2009, while no software development costs were capitalized during the first quarter of 2008. Although total RD expense increased 28%, it remained flat as a percentage of net sales,
which increased 6% in the first quarter of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in RD are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are
directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to continue to invest in RD to remain competitive.  
29 
Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SGA)  SGA increased 14% or $131 million to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2009 compared to $960 million in the first quarter of 2008. This increase
is primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the year-over-year increase in total net sales, an increase in SGA headcount, the Company's continued expansion of its Retail
segment, and higher spending on marketing and advertising.  Other Income and Expense  Total other income and expense decreased $42 million or 21% to $158 million during the first quarter of 2009 compared to $200 million in the first quarter of 2008. The overall decrease in other
income and expense is attributable to the decline in interest rates during the first quarter of 2009 as compared to the first quarter of 2008, partially offset by the Company's higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.
The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased to 2.37% in the first quarter of 2009 from 4.94% in the first quarter of 2008.  The Company's investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of $122 million and $121 million as of December27, 2008 and September27,
2008, respectively, which was partially offset by gross unrealized gains of $83 million and $4 million as of December27, 2008 and September27, 2008, respectively. In both periods, the gross unrealized losses primarily related to
long-term marketable securities. The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Company's marketable securities were caused primarily
by changes in market interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. The Company hasthe intent and ability to hold such investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested.
Accordingly,no declines in fair value were recognized in the Company's Condensed Statements of Operations.The Company may sell its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of
credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during the first quarters of 2009 or 2008 related to such sales.  Provision for Income Taxes  The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended
December27, 2008 was approximately 30% compared with approximately 32% for the quarter ended December29, 2007. The Company's effective rate for both periods differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to
certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax rate in the first three months of 2009 as compared to the same
quarter in 2008 is due primarily to the Company recording a tax benefit as a result of legislation enacted on October3, 2008, retroactively reinstating the research and development tax credit.  The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2002
through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by
state, local, and foreign tax authorities.Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues
addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  During the first
quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. In February
2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No.157. FSP157-2 delays the effective date of SFASNo.157 to fiscal years beginning after November15,
2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FSP157-2, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating
results.  
30 
In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.141
(revised 2007), Business Combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS No.141R also establishes principles around how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, as well as provides
guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. SFAS No.141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in
the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No.141R, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating
results.  In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan
amendment of FASB Statement No.133, which requires companies to provide additional disclosures about its objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for
under SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and related interpretations, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company's financial statements. SFAS No.161
also requires companies to disclose information about credit risk-related contingent features in their hedged positions. SFAS No.161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November15, 2008 and is required to be
adopted by the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No.161, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the
Company's financial condition or operating results.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of December27, 2008 and September27, 2008 (in millions):  
As of December27, 2008, the Company had $28.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities, an increase of $3.7 billion from September27, 2008. The principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $3.9 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisitions of
property, plant, and equipment of $339 million. The Company's cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the increase in deferred revenue, net of deferred costs, associated with subscription
accounting for iPhone.  The Company's marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities with
a minimum rating of single-A. As of December27, 2008 and September27, 2008, $12.7 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are
generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding
commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.  Capital Assets  The Company's cash payments for capital asset purchases were $339 million during the first quarter of 2009, consisting of approximately $71 million
for retail store facilities and $268 million for corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $1.3 billion for capital asset purchases during 2009, including
approximately $350 million for Retail facilities and approximately $950 million for corporate facilities and infrastructure.  
31 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other
contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
support to the Company.  Lease Commitments  As of September27, 2008, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. The Company's major
facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year
renewal options. Total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases related to the lease of retail space increased to $1.3 billion as of December27, 2008.  Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers  The Company utilizes
several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information
supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires
components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for
periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No.97-2 whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as
incurred. As of December27, 2008, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component purchase commitments, and estimated warranty commitments of $3.6 billion.  During 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25billion, which is being applied to certain inventory component purchases
made over the life of each respective agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the long-term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167million was repaid to the Company. As of
December27, 2008, the Company had $428million of inventory component prepayments outstanding.  Subsequent to December27,
2008, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement with LG Display to purchase LCD panels for five years. As part of the agreement, the Company is required to make a prepayment of $500million in the second quarter of 2009. 
Asset Retirement Obligations  The Company's
asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of December27, 2008, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of
approximately $28 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.  Other Obligations  Other outstanding obligations were approximately $371 million as of December27, 2008, primarily related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services,
and other obligations.  As of December27, 2008, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $560 million and an additional
$247 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years
due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.  Indemnifications  The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights.
Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party.
However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted 
32 
against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to
indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  
The
Company's market risk profile has not changed significantly during the first three months of 2009.  Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk
Management  The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in
conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the
hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments
for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Interest Rate Risk  While the Company is exposed to
interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest
rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, the fair value of those marketable securities, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  The Company's investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the Company. A
portion of the Company's cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company's investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. The Company's internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager
performance.  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment
portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better with the
objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company classifies its marketable securities
as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument's underlying contractual maturity date. All short-term marketable securities have maturities less than 12 months, while all long-term marketable securities have maturities ranging from
one to five years. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during the
first quarter of 2009 or 2008 related to such sales.  Foreign Currency Risk  In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively
affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in
foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to
protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to
hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure 
33 
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) were
effective as of December27, 2008 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii)accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2009, which were identified in
connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d)of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  
As of December27, 2008,
the end of the quarterly period covered by this report, the Company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below, as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen
in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2009 that did not individually or in the aggregate
have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.  Bader v. Anderson, et al.  Plaintiff filed this purported shareholder derivative action against the Company and each of its then current executive officers and members of its Board
of Directors on May19, 2005 in Santa Clara County Superior Court asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, material misstatements and omissions and violations of California Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair
competition). The complaint alleged that the Company's March14, 2005, proxy statement was false and misleading for failure to disclose certain information relating to the Apple Computer, Inc. Performance Bonus Plan, which was approved by
shareholders at the annual meeting held on April21, 2005. Plaintiff, who ostensibly brought suit on the Company's behalf, made no demand on the Board of Directors and alleged that such demand was excused. The complaint sought injunctive
and other relief for purported injury to the Company. On July27, 2005, plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging that, in addition to the purported derivative claims, adoption of the bonus plan and distribution of the proxy statement
describing that plan also inflicted injury on her directly as an individual shareholder. On January10, 2006, the Court sustained defendants' demurrer to the amended complaint, with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint on February7, 2006, and the Company filed a demurrer. After a hearing on June13, 2006, the Court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the non-director officers and with leave to amend as to the directors. On
July24, 2006, plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, which purported to bring claims derivatively as well as directly on behalf of a class of common stockholders who have been or will be harmed by virtue of the allegedly misleading proxy
statement. In addition to reasserting prior causes of action, the third amended complaint included a claim that the Company violated the terms of the plan, and a claim for waste related to restricted stock unit grants to certain officers in 2003 and
2004 and an option grant to the Company's CEO in January 2000. The Company filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint. On January30, 2007, the Court sustained the Company's demurrer with leave to amend. On May8, 2007,
plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint. The Company filed a demurrer to the fourth amended complaint, which the Court sustained, without leave to amend, on October12, 2007. On October25, 2007, the Court entered a final judgment in
favor of defendant and ordered the case dismissed with prejudice. On November26, 2007, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. Plaintiffs' appeal is pending.  Birdsong v. Apple Computer, Inc.  This action alleges that the Company's iPod music players, and
the ear bud headphones sold with them, are inherently defective in design and are sold without adequate warnings concerning the risk of noise-induced hearing loss by iPod users. The Birdsong action was initially filed on January30, 2006 in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana asserting Louisiana causes of action on behalf of a purported Louisiana class of iPod purchasers. A similar action (Patterson v. Apple Computer, Inc.) was filed on
January31, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting California causes of action on behalf of a purported class of all iPod purchasers within the four-year period before January31, 2006.
The Birdsong action was transferred to the Northern District of California, and the Patterson action was dismissed. An amended complaint was subsequently filed in Birdsong, dropping the Louisiana law-based claims and adding California law-based
claims equivalent to those in Patterson. After the Company filed a motion to dismiss on November3, 2006, plaintiffs agreed not to oppose the motion and filed a second amended complaint on January16, 2007. That complaint alleges
California law-based claims for breaches of implied and express warranties, violations of California Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition), California Business Professions Code 17500 (false
advertising), the Consumer Legal Remedies Act and negligent misrepresentation on behalf of a putative nationwide class and a 
35 
Louisiana law-based claim for redhibition for a Louisiana sub-class. On March1, 2007, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the California law-based
claims, which was heard on June4, 2007. On December14, 2007, the Court issued an order granting the Company's motion, with leave to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on January11, 2008. On
February15, 2008, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On June16, 2008, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice. On July11, 2008, plaintiffs
filed a notice of appeal. Plaintiffs' appeal is pending.  A similar complaint, Royer-Brennan v. Apple Computer, Inc. and Apple
Canada, Inc., was filed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on February1, 2006, seeking authorization to institute a class action on behalf of iPod purchasers in Quebec. At the request of plaintiffs' counsel, the Court has postponed class
certification proceedings in this action indefinitely.  Branning et al. v. Apple Computer, Inc.  Plaintiffs originally filed this purported class action in San Francisco County Superior Court on February17, 2005. The initial complaint alleged
violations of California Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition) and violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act regarding a variety of purportedly unfair and unlawful conduct including, but not limited to, allegedly
selling used computers as new and failing to honor warranties. Plaintiffs also brought causes of action for misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract and violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Plaintiffs requested
unspecified damages and other relief. On May2, 2005, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding two new named plaintiffs and three new causes of action including a claim for treble damages under the Cartwright Act (California
Business Professions Code 16700 et seq.) and a claim for false advertising. On May9, 2005, the Court granted the Company's motion to transfer the case to Santa Clara County Superior Court. The Company filed a demurrer to
the amended complaint, which the Court sustained in its entirety on November10, 2005. The Court granted plaintiffs leave to amend and they filed an amended complaint on December29, 2005. Plaintiffs' amended complaint added three
plaintiffs and alleged many of the same factual claims as the previous complaints, such as alleged selling of used equipment as new, alleged failure to honor warranties and service contracts for the consumer plaintiffs, and alleged fraud related to
the opening of the Apple retail stores. Plaintiffs continued to assert causes of action for unfair competition (17200), violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, violations of the
Cartwright Act, and alleged new causes of action for fraud, conversion, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Company filed a demurrer to the amended complaint on January31, 2006, which the Court sustained on
March3, 2006 on sixteen of seventeen causes of action. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding one new plaintiff. The Company filed a demurrer, which was granted in part on September9, 2006. Plaintiffs filed a further amended
complaint on September21, 2006. On October2, 2006, the Company filed an answer denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. On November30, 2007, the Company filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
which the Court denied. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint on March19, 2008 and a Corrected Fifth Amended Complaint on April1, 2008. The Company filed an answer to the Corrected Fifth Amended Complaint on April18, 2008. The
Company filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings for an order dismissing plaintiffs' fraud claim based upon the statute of limitations, which was granted by the Court on June24, 2008, with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed a Sixth
Amended Complaint on July14, 2008 and a Seventh Amended Complaint on August22, 2008, adding three new reseller plaintiffs. On August22, 2008, plaintiffs also filed a motion to certify the consumer class. On September22, 2008,
the Company filed its answer to the consumer-related claims denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses, and also filed a demurrer to the new reseller claims, which is set for a hearing on January30, 2009. The Company
filed motions for summary adjudication for certain claims of two named plaintiffs', which the Court granted on November10, 2008. Plaintiffs petitioned the Court of Appeal for a writ of certiorari from the summary adjudication ruling and a
motion to stay the class certification hearing, which the Court of Appeal denied on December17, 2008. On December19, 2008, the Court held a hearing on plaintiffs' class certification motion. The Court requested further briefing and
an additional hearing is set for February20, 2009.  Gordon v. Apple Computer, Inc.  Plaintiff filed this purported class action on August31, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division, on behalf of a purported
nationwide class of consumers who purchased 65W Power Adapters for iBooks and Powerbooks between November 2002 and the present. The complaint alleges various problems with the 65W Adapter, including fraying, sparking, and premature failure.
Plaintiff alleges violations of California Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition), the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and breach of warranties. The complaint seeks damages and
36 
equitable relief. The Company filed an answer on October20, 2006 denying the material allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The
Company has reached a settlement of this matter and the parties have received final court approval for the settlement.  Harvey v. Apple Inc.
Plaintiff filed this action on August6, 2007 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall
Division, alleging infringement by the Company of U.S. Patent No.6,753,671 entitled Recharger for use with a portable electronic device and which includes a proximally located light emitting device and U.S. Patent
No.6,762,584 entitled Recharger for use with a portable electronic device and which includes a connector terminus for communicating with rechargeable batteries contained within the device. The complaint seeks unspecified damages
and other relief. The Company filed an answer on October12, 2007 denying all material allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The Company also asserted counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity.
On April7, 2008, plaintiff filed an amended complaint further alleging infringement of the reissue patent of U.S. Patent No.6,753,671. On April28, 2008, the Company filed an answer denying all material allegations and asserting
numerous affirmative defenses. The Company also asserted counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. The Markman hearing is set for October28, 2009, and trial is scheduled for April5, 2010.  Honeywell International,Inc., et al.v. Apple Computer,Inc., et al.  Plaintiffs Honeywell International,Inc. and Honeywell Intellectual Properties,Inc. filed this action on October6, 2004 in the United States District Court in Delaware alleging infringement by the
Company and other defendants of U.S. Patent 5,280,371 entitled Directional Diffuser for a Liquid Crystal Display. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief. The Company filed an answer on December21, 2004 denying all
material allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The Company has tendered the case to several liquid crystal display manufacturer suppliers. On May18, 2005 the Court stayed the case against the Company and the other
non-manufacturer defendants. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November7, 2005 adding additional defendants and expanding the scope of the accused products. The Company's response to the amended complaint is not yet due. On
April2, 2008, the Court lifted the stay for the purpose of determining whether the liquid crystal display manufacturer suppliers used by the Company and certain other defendants are licensed under the 371 patent. On October31,
2008, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement based on the contention that its suppliers are licensed under the 371 patent. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for January30, 2009.  In re Apple Computer, Inc. Derivative Litigation (formerly Karant v. Jobs, et al. and Related Actions) (Federal Action)  On June30, 2006, a putative derivative action captioned Karant v. Jobs, et. al., was filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California, San Jose Division. A number of related actions were filed in the subsequent weeks and have been consolidated into a single action captioned In re Apple Computer, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Master File No.
C-06-04128-JF before the Hon. Jeremy Fogel. The actions were filed after the Company's announcement on June29, 2006 that an internal investigation had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of certain stock option grants made
between 1997 and 2001, that a special committee of the Company's outside directors had retained independent counsel to perform an investigation and that the Company had informed the Securities and Exchange Commission. The action purports to
assert claims on behalf of the Company against several current and former executive officers and members of the Board of Directors alleging improper backdating of stock option grants to maximize certain defendants' profits, failing to properly
account for and take tax deductions for those grants, insider trading, and issuing false financial statements. The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The consolidated complaint alleges various causes of action under federal and California law,
including claims for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of the California Corporations Code, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, rescission, constructive fraud and waste of corporate assets, as well as claims under Sections
10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act. Plaintiffs seek damages, disgorgement, restitution and imposition of a constructive trust. A Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint was filed on December18, 2006, and a
FirstAmended Shareholder Derivative Complaint was filed on March6, 2007. On June12, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved a resolution appointing a Special Litigation Committee to make all decisions relating to
options litigation. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on April20, 2007, which was heard on September7, 2007. On November19, 2007, the Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint on December19, 2007. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint on January25, 2008. The motions to dismiss were originally scheduled to be heard on April4, 2008. Pursuant to a joint stipulation
filed on April3, 2008, the Court vacated the hearing date. The parties have reached a settlement, and the Court has granted final approval of the settlement. On November10, 2008, the Court entered final judgment and dismissed the case.

In re Apple Computer, Inc. Derivative Litigation (formerly Plumbers and Pipefitters v. Jobs, et al.
and Related Actions) (State Action); Boston Retirement Board v. Apple Computer, Inc.  On July5, 2006, a putative derivative action
captioned Plumbers and Pipefitters v. Jobs, et. al., was filed in California Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara. A number of related actions were filed in the subsequent weeks, and have been consolidated into a single action
captioned In re Apple Computer, Inc. Derivative Litigation, No.1:06CV066692, assigned to the Hon. Joseph Huber. These actions purport to assert claims on behalf of the Company against several current and former executive officers and
members of the Board of Directors alleging improper backdating of stock option grants to maximize certain defendants' profits, failing to properly account for and take tax deductions for those grants and issuing false financial statements. The
Company is named as a nominal defendant. A consolidated complaint was filed on October5, 2006, alleging a variety of causes of action under California law, including claims for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of the

Following a trial held on September24, 2007, the Court granted the petition for inspection but narrowed the scope of the records to be produced.On April16, 2008, the Boston Retirement Board filed a derivative action in California
Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara. On July31, 2008, Boston Retirement Board attempted to serve the new complaint on the Company. On September15, 2008, defendants filed a motion to quash service of summons. On October17,
2008, the Court denied defendants' motion to quash. On October20, 2008, defendants requested consolidation of this action with In re Apple Computer, Inc. Derivative Litigation, No.1:06CV066692, and a stay of the action. On
November6, 2008, Boston Retirement Board filed a motion for fees. On November7, 2008, the Court issued an order relating this action to the State Derivative Litigation. A stipulation for dismissal was filed on December10, 2008, in
which Boston Retirement Board agrees to dismiss the case with prejudice upon a final order regarding its fees motion. On January15, 2009, the Court denied Boston Retirement Board's motion for fees.  In re Apple iPod Nano Products Liability Litigation (formerly Wimmer v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Moschella, et al., v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Calado, et
al. v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Kahan, et al., v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Jennings, et al., v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Rappel v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Mayo v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Valencia v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Williamson v. Apple Computer, Inc.;
Sioson v. Apple Computer, Inc.  Beginning on October19, 2005, eight complaints were filed in various United States District Courts
and two complaints were filed in California State Court alleging that the Company's iPod nano was defectively designed so that it scratches excessively during normal use, rendering the screen unreadable.  The federal actions were coordinated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and assigned to the Hon. Ronald Whyte
pursuant to an April17, 2006 order of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Plaintiffs filed a First Consolidated and Amended Master Complaint on September21, 2006, alleging violations of California and other states'
consumer protection and warranty laws and claiming unjust enrichment. The Master Complaint alleges two putative plaintiff classes: (1)all U.S. residents (excluding California residents) who purchased an iPod nano that was not manufactured or
designed using processes necessary to ensure normal resistance to scratching of the screen; and (2)all iPod nano purchasers other than U.S. residents who purchased an iPod nano that was not manufactured or designed using processes necessary to
ensure normal resistance to scratching of the screen. The Company answered the Master Complaint on November20, 2006.  The two
California State Court actions were coordinated on May4, 2006, and assigned to the Hon. Carl West in Los Angeles Superior Court. Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on June8, 2006, alleging violations of
California state consumer protection, unfair competition, false advertising and warranty laws and claiming unjust enrichment. The Consolidated Complaint alleges a putative plaintiff class of all California residents who own an iPod nano containing a
manufacturing defect that results in the nano being susceptible to excessive 
38 
scratching. The Company answered the Consolidated Amended Complaint on October6, 2006. The parties have reached a settlement and the Court has granted
preliminary approval of the settlement. The parties' request for final approval of the settlement is pending.  Individual Networks, LLC v. Apple,

Company of the Canadian Private Copying Levy that was applied to the iPod purchase price in Quebec between December12, 2003 and December14, 2004 but later declared invalid by the Canadian Court. The Company has completed a refund program
for this levy. A class certification hearing took place January13, 2006. On February24, 2006, the Court granted class certification and notice was published during the last week of March 2006. The trial was conducted on October15
and 16, 2007. On January11, 2008, the Court issued a ruling in plaintiff's favor. The Court ruled that despite the Company's good faith efforts with the levy refund program, the Company must pay the amount claimed, and that the class
is comprised of 20,000 persons who purchased an iPod in 
39 
Quebec between December12, 2003 and December14, 2004. The Court ordered the Company to submit a statement of account showing the amount received
by the Canadian Private Copying Collective, and the amount that has already been paid to class members in Quebec under the Company's levy refund program. The Court also ordered the parties to submit further briefing regarding the collective
recovery award by February23, 2008. On February11, 2008, the Company filed an appeal. The Company's appeal is pending.  Texas MP3
Technologies Ltd v. Apple Inc. et al.  Plaintiff filed this action against the Company and other defendants on February16, 2007 in

2007, adding the iPhone as an accused device. On August2, 2007, the Company filed a motion to stay the litigation pending the outcome of the reexamination, which the Court denied. The Company filed an answer on August20, 2007, denying
all material allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The Company also asserted counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. The Markman hearing is set for March12, 2009, and trial is scheduled for
July6, 2009.  The Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation (formerly Charoensak v. Apple Computer, Inc. and Tucker v. Apple
Computer, Inc.); Somers v. Apple Inc.  The first-listed action is a consolidated case combining two cases previously pending under the
names Charoensak v. Apple Computer Inc. (formerly Slattery v. Apple Computer Inc.) and Tucker v. Apple Computer, Inc. The original plaintiff (Slattery) in the Charoensak case filed a purported class action on January3, 2005 in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging various claims including alleged unlawful tying of music purchased on the iTunes Store with the purchase of iPods and unlawful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly
market power. Plaintiff's complaint alleged violations of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 and 2), California Business Professions Code 16700 et seq. (the Cartwright Act), California
Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition), common law unjust enrichment and common law monopolization. Plaintiff sought unspecified damages and other relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on February10,
2005. On September9, 2005, the Court denied the motion in part and granted it in part. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on September23, 2005 and the Company filed an answer on October18, 2005. In August 2006, the Court
dismissed Slattery without prejudice and allowed plaintiffs to file an amended complaint naming two new plaintiffs (Charoensak and Rosen). On November2, 2006, the Company filed an answer to the amended complaint denying all material
allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses.  The Tucker case was filed as a purported class action on July21, 2006 in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging various claims including alleged unlawful tying of music and videos purchased on the iTunes Store with the purchase of iPods and vice versa and unlawful acquisition or
maintenance of monopoly market power. The complaint alleges violations of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 and 2), California Business Professions Code 16700 et seq. (the Cartwright Act), California
Business Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition) and the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act. Plaintiff sought unspecified damages and other relief. On November3, 2006, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint. On December20, 2006, the Court denied the motion to dismiss. On January11, 2007, the Company filed an answer denying all material allegations and asserting numerous defenses.  On March20, 2007, the Court consolidated the two cases. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on April19, 2007. On June6, 2007, the
Company filed an answer to the consolidated complaint denying all material allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. On July17, 2008, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification and on October17, 2008, the Company
filed its opposition to plaintiffs' motion. The class certification hearing took place on December16, 2008. On December22, 2008, the Court granted certification of the monopolization claims and denied without prejudice certification
of the tying claims pending reconsideration of its denial of the Company's motion to dismiss.  A related class action complaint,
Somers v. Apple Inc., was filed on December31, 2007 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims including alleged unlawful tying of music and videos purchased on the iTunes Store
with the purchase of iPods and vice versa and unlawful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly market power. The complaint alleges violations of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 
40 
U.S.C. 1 and 2), California Business Professions Code 16700 et seq. (the Cartwright Act), California Business
Professions Code 17200 (unfair competition) and the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act. Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and other relief. On February21, 2008, the Company filed an answer denying all material allegations and
asserting numerous defenses. The Court has scheduled the class certification hearing for June1, 2009.  Tse v. Apple Computer, Inc. et al. 
Plaintiff Ho Keung Tse filed this action against the Company and other defendants on August5, 2005 in the United States District
Court for the District of Maryland alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No.6,665,797 entitled Protection of Software Again [sic] Against Unauthorized Use. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The Company filed
an answer on October31, 2005 denying all material allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. On October28, 2005, the Company and the other defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to the Northern District of
California, which was granted on August31, 2006. On July24, 2007, the Company filed a petition for reexamination of the patent, which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted. On July25, 2007, the Company filed a motion to stay
the litigation pending the outcome of the reexamination, which the Court granted on October4, 2007.  Union F&eacute;d&eacute;rale des
Consummateurs - Que Choisir v. Apple Computer France S.&agrave;.r.l. and iTunes S.&agrave;.r.l.  Plaintiff, a consumer association in
France, filed this complaint on February9, 2005 alleging that the above-listed entities are violating consumer law by (1)omitting to mention that the iPod is allegedly not compatible with music from online music services other than the
iTunes Store and that the music from the iTunes Store is only compatible with the iPod and (2)allegedly tying the sales of iPods to the iTunes Store and vice versa. Plaintiff seeks damages, injunctive relief and other relief. The first hearing
on the case took place on May24, 2005. The Company's response to the complaint was served on November8, 2005. Plaintiff's responsive pleading was filed on February10, 2006. The Company filed a reply on June6, 2006
and UFC filed a response on September19, 2006.  Vitt v. Apple Computer, Inc.  Plaintiff filed this purported class action on November7, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of a purported nationwide class of all

Business Professions Code 17500 (false advertising). Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on January19, 2007, which the Court granted on March13, 2007. Plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint on March26, 2007. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on August16, 2007, which was heard on October4, 2007. The Court has not yet issued a ruling.  Vogel v. Jobs et al. (2006 Action)  Plaintiffs filed
this purported class action on August24, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors alleging improper
backdating of stock option grants to maximize certain defendants' profits, failing to properly account for those grants and issuing false financial statements. On January19, 2007, the Court appointed the New York City Employees'
Retirement System as lead plaintiff. On March23, 2007, plaintiffsfiled a Consolidated Class Action Complaint. TheConsolidatedComplaint purports to be brought on behalf of several classes of holders of the Company's stock
andasserts claims under Section14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Actas well as state law. The Consolidated Complaint seeks rescission of amendments to various stock option and other incentive compensation plans, an

District of California against the Company and certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors. 
41 
The allegations, which arise out of the Company's past stock option practices, are similar to those in the 2006 Vogel v. Jobs et al. action that
was dismissed on June12, 2008, as described above. The complaint purports to be brought on behalf of several classes of holders of the Company's stock and asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act. The
complaint seeks rescission of amendments to various stock option and other incentive compensation plans, an accounting and damages in an unspecified amount. On July22, 2008, the Court stayed this case pending the appeal in the 2006 Action.
Because of the following factors, as
well as other factors affecting the Company's financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to
anticipate results or trends in future periods.  Economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.  The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions
poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending inresponse to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on demand for the Company's
products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company's expectations since the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to offset the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a
trend that has been very pronounced recently. Other factors that could influence demand include continuing increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access
to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company's products and services and on the
Company's financial condition and operating results.  The current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and
financialmarkets and the possibility additional financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in a tightening in the creditmarkets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, andextreme
volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. Therecould be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis onthe Company's business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain
credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting inproduct delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to financepurchases of the Company's products and/or customer, including
channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the Company's treasury operations. Other income andexpense also could vary materially from expectations
depending on gains or lossesrealized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equitysecurities and other investments; interest rates;cash balances; and changes in
fair value of derivative instruments.The current volatility in the financial markets and overall economicuncertainty increase the risk the actual amounts realized in thefuture on the Company's financial instruments could
differ significantlyfrom the fair values currently assigned to them.  Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also
continue to increase the volatility of the Company's stock price.  The matters relating to the Company's past stock option
practices and the restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation.  The findings
from the Company's investigation into its past stock option granting practices and the resulting restatement of prior financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year September30, 2006 (the
2006 Form 10-K) have exposed the Company to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. As described in Part II, Item1, Legal Proceedings, several derivative and
class action complaints have been filed in state and federal courts against the Company and certain current and former directors and executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to past stock option grants. The Company has provided the
results of its investigation to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, and the Company has responded to their requests for documents and
additional information. The Company intends to continue to provide its full cooperation.  
42 
On April24, 2007, the SEC filed an enforcement action against two former officers of the Company.
In announcing the lawsuit, the SEC stated that it would not bring an enforcement action against the Company based in part on the Company's swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission's investigation.
According to the SEC's statement, the Company's cooperation consisted of, among other things, prompt self-reporting, an independent internal investigation, the sharing of the results of that investigation with the government, and the
implementation of new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct. The enforcement actions against each of these former officers have now been settled.  No assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from litigation relating to the Company's past stock option practices. These and related matters have required, and will continue to require,
the Company to incur substantial expenses for legal, accounting, tax, and other professional services, and may divert management's attention from the Company's business. If the Company is subject to adverse findings, it could be required
to pay damages and penalties and might face additional remedies that could harm its financial condition and operating results.  Global
markets for personal computers, digital music devices, mobile communication devices, and related peripherals and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in these
markets, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The Company competes in global markets
that are highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in
product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.  The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it
is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its personal computers, consumer electronics, and mobile communication devices, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services.
As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research and development and as such, the Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents,
trademarks and service marks. By contrast, many of the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products
with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the Company's intellectual property, the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and operating results could
be materially adversely affected.  In the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number of
competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. Consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. Price competition has been particularly
intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. The Company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, SMB, education, enterprise,
government, and creative markets. An increasing number of Internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company's existing products.
The Company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal
computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. The Company's financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company's ability to continually
improve the Mac platform to maintain functional and design advantages. Use of unauthorized copies of the Mac OS on other companies' hardware products may result in decreased demand for the Company's hardware products, and could materially
adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company is currently focused on certain mobile
communication devices, such as iPhone, consumer electronic devices, including the iPod family of digital music players, and digital content distribution. The Company faces 
43 
substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources, as well as established hardware,
software, and digital content supplier relationships. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain digital content. The Company has only recently entered the mobile communications market, and many of its competitors in the mobile
communications market have significantly greater experience, product breadth, and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and experience and a lower cost structure, they may
be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company's approach to providing these components seamlessly within
their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.  The Company currently receives subsidies from its
exclusive and non-exclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company's agreements with these carriers or in
agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.  There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products
and services that compete effectively.  To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage
frequent product introductions and transitions.  Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer, consumer
electronics and mobile communication industries, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The
success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the
availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet
anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its
financial condition and operating results.  The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk.  The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and
accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Although the Company believes its inventory, asset, and related
provisions are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal computer, consumer electronics, and mobile communication industries, the Company will not incur
additional inventory or asset related charges. Such charges have had, and could have, a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired
through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand. Such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days. Because the Company's
markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products. The Company's
financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.
44 
Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain key components including,
but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities.  Because the
Company currently obtains certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and ASICs, from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing
risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including, but not limited to NAND flash memory, DRAM and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing
fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be
able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price
increases that can have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results. The Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007,
due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, and higher logistical costs.
For additional information refer to Part I, Item2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the subheading Gross Margin, which is incorporated herein by
reference.  The Company and other participants in the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries compete
for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics or mobile communication
industries. The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product
uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available
only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the
U.S.  Most of the Company's components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. Many
of these manufacturers are located outside of the U.S., and are geographically concentrated in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs,
they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company's flexibility to respond to
changing conditions. In addition, the Company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the Company's supplier code of conduct. Although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the
Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, financial condition and operating results.  Final assembly of the Company's
products is currently performed in the Company's manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by external vendors in California, Korea, China and the Czech Republic. Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by
sole-sourced third-party vendors in the U.S., China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Sole-sourced third-party vendors in China perform final assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable products,
including MacBook Pro, MacBook, MacBook Air, iPods, iPhones and most of the Company's iMacs. If manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, information technology system failures,
military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  
45 
The Company relies on third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on
commercially reasonable terms or at all.  The Company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the
Company's iTunes Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to audio and video content. The Company's licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of
these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license
their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at
reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the Company's financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.  Many third-party content providers require that the Company provide certain digital rights management (DRM) and other security solutions. If these requirements change, the Company may
have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may
propose legislation that would force the Company to license its DRM, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the Company's content providers.  The Company relies on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the Company's future results could be materially adversely
affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights.  Many of the Company's products are designed to
include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the Company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods. Although the Company believes that, based on past experience and industry
practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all.  Because of technological changes in the global personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new
patents, it is possible that certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it
may be infringing such rights. Regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense. At present, the Company is vigorously defending more than 26 patent infringement cases, eight of which were filed during fiscal
2009, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If the Company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or
selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of
whether it can develop non-infringing technology. While in management's opinion the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or
other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the
Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the Company's
financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  With the June 2007 introduction of iPhone, the Company
has begun to compete with mobile communication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios.Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents orthe merits of anypotential patent claims by competitors, the Company may
have to engage in protracted litigation, enter into expensive agreements or settlements and/ormodify its products. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.
46 
The Company's future performance depends on support from third-party software developers. If
third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.  The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its Macs, iPods and iPhones, are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party
software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the Company's products on a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these
applications and services could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  With
respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading
such software for the Company's products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued
acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company's minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Company's prospects, developers could
be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. The Company's development of its own software
applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as Microsoft, Adobe, and Google, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the Company's products. Mac
OS X Leopard, which became available in October 2007, includes a new feature that enables Intel-based Mac systems to run Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems. This feature may deter developers from creating software applications
for Mac OS X if such applications are already available for the Windows platform.  With respect to iPhone and iPod touch, the Company
relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications. Unlike third-party software applications for Mac products, the software applications for the iPhone and iPod touch platforms are distributed
through a single distribution channel, the iTunes Store. The absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Company's
customers, thereby causing developers to curtail significantly, or stop, development for the Company's platforms. In addition, iPhone and iPod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to keep up
with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. Further, if the Company develops its own software applications and services, such development may negatively affect the
decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive applications for the iPhone and iPod touch platforms. As with applications for the Company's Mac products, the availability and development of these
applications also depend on developers' perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Company's products rather than its competitors' products, including devices that use competing platforms. If
developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices may suffer.  The Company's products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin.  The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as
those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software's intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no
assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, harm to reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a
material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company expects its quarterly revenue and
operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.  The Company's profit margins vary among its products and its distribution
channels. The Company's software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company's other products. Gross margins on the Company's hardware products vary across product
lines and can change over 
47 
time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company's direct
sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company's gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely
impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, or price competition. The Company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the
second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year, respectively. Furthermore, the Company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter than it does
during either of the first two months. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics, components supply, or
manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  In
certain countries, including the U.S., the Company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iPhone.  In each
of the U.S., U.K., Germany, Spain, Ireland, and certain other countries, the Company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iPhone on an exclusive basis. If these exclusive carriers cannot successfully compete
with other carriers in their markets on any basis, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services, performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other terms of conditions
of end-user contracts, or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iPhone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected.  The Company is subject to risks associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications devices.
Laws and regulations related to mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and
subject to change. Such changes, whichcould include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carrier's network, or mandating the use of the device on more
than one carrier's network, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Mobile communication devices, such as iPhone, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.These certification processes are
extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.
The Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.
Information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company's operations
by causing delays or cancellation of customer, including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the Company's online offerings and services, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting
financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information, or damage to the Company's reputation. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security
and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company's stock price continues to be volatile.  The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by the Company and its competitors, or
uncertainty about current global economic conditions. The stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to
these companies' operating performance. Furthermore, the Company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline.
48 
Political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances
could materially adversely affect the Company.  War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business
interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers,
including channel partners. The Company's business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its
control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company's products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and
create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in
freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company's manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority
of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major
seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, the Company's financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.  The Company's success depends largely on the continued service
and availability of key personnel.  Much of the Company's future success depends on the continued service and availability of
skilled personnel, including its CEO, its executive team and key employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in
the Silicon Valley, where most of the Company's key employees are located. The Company's CEO has taken a medical leave of absence until the end of June and plans to remain involved in major strategic decisions during his leave. There can
be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully retain key personnel.  Market and regulatory developments may limit the Company's
ability to use equity compensation to attract and retain key personnel.  The Company has relied on equity awards as one means for
recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stock-based compensation expense, which has caused the Company to reduce the number of stock-based awards
issued to employees and could negatively impact the Company's ability to attract and retain key personnel. Additionally, significant adverse volatility in the Company's stock price could result in a stock option's exercise price
exceeding the underlying stock's market value or a significant deterioration in the value of restricted stock units granted, thus lessening the effectiveness of retaining employees through stock-based awards. There can be no assurance that the
Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel.  Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially
adversely affect the Company.  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary
conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to the
Company's operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into material settlements. Should the Company fail to prevail in certain matters, or should
several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and
might materially affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company's business is subject to the
risks of international operations.  The Company derives a large and growing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international
operations. As a result, its financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes
on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. Margins on sales of the 
49 
Company's products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely
affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia, as well as non-U.S. dollar denominated operating
expenses incurred throughout the world. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the
Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar's
strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the Company's
foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company's cost of product components
denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  The Company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign
exchange forward and option positions, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable
movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.  The Company's retail business has required and
will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  Through December27, 2008, the Company had opened 251 retail stores. The Company's retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel.
The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to
promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company's more typical retail
stores. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and
leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company's control, pose risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the Retail segment's future results, cause
its actual results to differ from anticipated results and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, macro-economic factors that could
have a negative effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company's inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships
with existing retail channel partners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in
quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.  Investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company's
ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.  The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business
strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy,
inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company's due diligence. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  
50 
The Company's future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers,
and other resellers.  The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, value-added
resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end-users, certain education customers,
and certain resellers through its online and retail stores. iPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers' distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers.  Many resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. Some resellers have perceived
the expansion of the Company's direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company's products. Such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and
sale of the Company's products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company's financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers
weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. The Company has
invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a
substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.  The Company is exposed to credit risk and
fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.  Although the Company has not recognized any material losses on its cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results. Given the global nature of its business, the Company has
investments both domestically and internationally. Additionally, the Company's overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in the financial sector, which has been negatively impacted by the recent market liquidity conditions. Credit
ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has
unsecured non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by contract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated
with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no
assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection.  The Company's products and services, and the production and distribution of those goods and services, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations. These may require the Company to offer
customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the
Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of its operations and the
thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  
51 
Changes in the Company's tax rates could affect its future results.  The Company's future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes
in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The
Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.  The Company is subject to risks associated with the
availability and coverage of insurance.  For certain risks, the Company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or
availability.Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self-insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition and operating results.
